# why we resize the embeddings to be the same as the len of tokenizer?

    # We resize the embeddings only when necessary to avoid index errors. If you are creating a model from scratch
    # on a small vocab and want a smaller embedding size, remove this test.
    embedding_size = model.get_input_embeddings().weight.shape[0]
    if len(tokenizer) > embedding_size:
        model.resize_token_embeddings(len(tokenizer))


The code you've shared is related to the process of fine-tuning a pre-trained language model with a new tokenizer. Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

1. `embedding_size = model.get_input_embeddings().weight.shape[0]`: This line is getting the size of the input embeddings from the pre-trained model. The input embeddings are a learned representation of the input tokens (words, subwords, or characters, depending on the tokenizer) that the model uses to understand the input text. The size of the input embeddings is typically equal to the size of the vocabulary that the model was trained on.

2. `if len(tokenizer) > embedding_size:`: This line is checking if the size of the new tokenizer's vocabulary is larger than the size of the input embeddings. If it is, this means that there are tokens in the new vocabulary that the pre-trained model doesn't have embeddings for.

3. `model.resize_token_embeddings(len(tokenizer))`: If the new tokenizer's vocabulary is larger, this line resizes the input embeddings to match the size of the new vocabulary. This is necessary because the model needs an embedding for every token in the vocabulary. Without this step, if the model encountered a token in the new vocabulary that it didn't have an embedding for, it would throw an index error.

The comment at the top explains that this resizing is only done when necessary to avoid index errors. If you're training a model from scratch on a small vocabulary and want a smaller embedding size, you can remove this check. However, if you're fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a new vocabulary, this check is necessary to ensure that the model has embeddings for all the tokens it might encounter.
