COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A South Carolina woman who spent two months chained inside a large metal container says her captor raped her daily and bragged that he was good at killing, claiming that his victims tallied nearly 100.
Kala Brown says she did what she had to do to survive.
"He told me as long as I served my purpose, I was safe," Brown told Phillip McGraw, the host of the television show "Dr. Phil."
It was the first time she has talked publicly since her Nov. 3 rescue, which authorities say helped them solve seven killings in the area dating back 13 years. Police said Todd Kohlhepp, a real estate agent with his own firm until his arrest, killed Brown's boyfriend, a couple who had been missing nearly a year and four people at a motorcycle shop in 2003.
Brown said she and her boyfriend had gone to Kohlhepp's rural property Aug. 31 to help him clear some underbrush. She'd cleaned houses for him previously to prepare them for sale. After the couple followed him to a two-story garage on the 95-acre property in Spartanburg County, Kohlhepp handed them hedge clippers and bottles of water. He said he needed to get something inside and came out shooting, Brown said.
He shot Charles Carver three times in the chest, she said. He gagged Brown and handcuffed her ankles and wrists. Kohlhepp took her to a "pitch black," 30-foot-long storage container nearby, chained her by the neck in a back corner and raped her, she said.
He "let me know that if I tried to run, he'd kill me. If I tried to hurt him, he'd kill me. If I fought back, he would kill me. And then he raped me," Brown said in episodes that aired this week. "He would rape me twice a day, every day."
The days evolved into a pattern, she said.
He took her to the garage twice a day, where she ate, used the bathroom and was allowed to bathe every other day using a washcloth and a small plastic bowl of water. But she was never unchained, she said.
"He would put more chains on before he took other chains off," she said.
Kohlhepp, 45, faces murder, kidnapping and weapons charges. He is not charged with sexual assault. Spokesmen for the sheriff and prosecutor declined to address the rape allegations or whether more charges are forthcoming. His attorney did not return messages.
The Associated Press normally does not identify victims of sexual assault but is naming Brown after she publicly identified herself.
The day after her rescue, investigators found Carver's body in a shallow grave on Kohlhepp's property. Brought to the site in handcuffs, Kohlhepp showed authorities the graves of the couple missing since December 2015. Kohlhepp told Brown he held that woman captive, too, before killing her.
Police said Kohlhepp acknowledged the grisly 2003 cold case after authorities granted him several requests, including letting him speak to his mother.
Brown said Kohlhepp told her he killed Carver because "it was easier to control someone if you took someone they loved."
She thought Kohlhepp was infatuated with her and didn't want to kill her, even saying he would let her go and give her money "if he ever got old and sick," she said. He explained Stockholm syndrome, in which a hostage starts feeling sympathetic toward their captor, and said "it would kick in and we'd be happy together."
He twice let her see parts of the property beyond the garage and container, including once chained to a four-wheeler.
"I had been in a dark, small, enclosed space and couldn't move more than a few feet. I was thrilled to be outdoors," she said.
When Brown heard people talking outside the container the morning of Nov. 3, she panicked, thinking maybe he had brought someone else. When she realized help had come, "I started screaming and hitting the walls," she said.
"I knew my family would never stop looking, but he was so careful, I couldn't see how I could be found so soon. I was scared it really wasn't happening," she said. "And when they finally got the door open and I saw the police uniforms, I was relieved."
Russian intelligence officials made repeated contact with members of President Trump's campaign staff, according to new reports that cite anonymous U.S. officials. American agencies were concerned about the contacts but haven't seen proof of collusion between the campaign and the Russian security apparatus, the reports say.
Law enforcement and intelligence agencies intercepted the calls at the same time as they investigated Russia's attempts to tamper with the presidential election, according to The New York Times, which first reported the contacts.
According to CNN, "The communications were intercepted during routine intelligence collection targeting Russian officials and other Russian nationals known to U.S. intelligence."
Both CNN and the Times cite multiple current and former U.S. officials as the sources for their stories.
Reporter Matt Apuzzo, part of the Times team that broke the story, tells NPR's Morning Edition that while officials said they haven't seen proof of collusion — "just the flurry of contacts was enough, and the timing of the contacts, was enough to get them very concerned."
U.S. agencies are still working to determine the reasons behind the contacts, officials tell both news outlets.
President Trump called the reports "conspiracy theories" early Wednesday, in response to the stories:
"The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred," the president wrote. He then added that MSNBC and CNN are "unwatchable," while the Fox News program Fox & Friends "is great."
The Kremlin had a similar response, with Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying, "Let us not believe in what media say, for nowadays it is very difficult to tell actual news from fake ones."
That's according to state-run Tass media, which adds that Peskov also criticized the use of anonymous sources by the media.
Allegations about Trump's involvement with Russia have ranged from reports last month of a dossier that alleged collusion between the then-candidate and Russian President Vladimir Putin to a public call from the candidate himself last July, when he urged Russian agents to "find" Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's emails and release them.
The FBI has been investigating contacts between Trump aides and Russia; in Congress, there are also calls for public investigations. Last month, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence announced it would investigate allegations that Russia meddled in the U.S. elections.
But there is resistance among Republicans in Congress to go after one of their own, particularly as the new president is settling into the White House.
Republican Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana, who's on the House Judiciary Committee, tells Morning Edition, "I don't think we need an independent investigation here, I think we need to let the Intelligence and the Judiciary committees do their work."
That work, he said, includes receiving classified briefings about the new allegations. Johnson also raised questions about leaks in the government — particularly of information that's drawn from surveillance that swept up the communications of U.S. citizens.
"There are some serious legal implications here," Johnson said, "but it has nothing to do with partisan politics. I mean, the leak of highly classified information by what is apparent here — a number of individuals inside our intelligence community — is the illegal act that I think we need to review."
Johnson also faulted intelligence agencies for not doing more to protect the identity of Americans — such as former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn — whose communications with a foreign national were monitored.
New reports of contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia follow the exit of a third member of Donald Trump's inner circle in the past 12 months amid allegations of inappropriate contact with the country:
Michael Flynn resigned as national security adviser this week over the handling of his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S.;
Paul Manafort, resigned as Trump's campaign chairman last August amid reports of his attempts to align Trump's policies with Russian interests;
Carter Page removed himself as a foreign policy adviser last September, as reports emerged about a visit to Russia and other potential contacts.
Manafort and Flynn were among the senior Trump team members who were "regularly communicating with Russian nationals," CNN reports.
In an interview with the Times, Manafort called the officials' account "absurd" and said he had never had anything to do with Putin's government.
Manafort told the newspaper, "It's not like these people wear badges that say, 'I'm a Russian intelligence officer.'"
HAMPTON BAYS, N.Y. (CBSNewYork) — Two Long Island oyster divers and a dog were rescued after they were marooned in Moriches Bay during Monday night’s violent wind storm.
It was pitch dark and bitter cold, but all in a night’s work for the first responders.
Stuck on a sandbar, Jimmy Launonen began to lose consciousness with his fishing buddy Noah Gorman and dog Reba by his side, CBS2’s Jennifer McLogan reported.
“We were trying to push the boat out for about a half hour, but after that we realized that wasn’t happening,” Launonen recalled.
Half submerged, they finally called 911 as their boat drifted toward Pikes Beach.
“Pinpointed their location in the bay through our GPS system, the phone system, and was able to direct responders to where they were,” South Hampton Police Lt. Susan Ralph said.
“We were strobing, and they were able to see us from the shoreline,” Launonen said.
At the Eastport dock, restaurant patrons stopped eating.
“We were all inside Trumpets praying. Now we find out it’s a boat with people in it and a dog, our hearts were pounding,” owner Helen Fehr said.
“Noah said, ‘mom, I rubbed Jimmy’s feet. That’s how bad, that’s how worried I was about him that I rubbed his feet. Worried about hypothermia and frostbite,'” Gorman’s mother Eileen Mackey said.
Suddenly, Eastport Fire Rescue, the Coast Guard, Southampton police, Westhampton ambulance, East and Center Moriches fire and the Suffolk County Marine Bureau converged on the scene.
“More than 30, there were lights everywhere, the whole bay was lit up with lights. It was an amazing scene actually,” Launonen said.
“They’re all heroes,” Ralph added.
The two rescued men first told responders they were humiliated they had to call for help. The bay constable said if they waited any longer, it may not have been a happy ending.
Both the oyster divers and the dog Reba, a German short-haired pointer, were treated for hypothermia.
There's an unplanned experiment going on in the northern Rocky Mountains. What's happening is that spring is arriving earlier, and it's generally warmer and drier than usual. And that's messing with some of the fish that live there.
The fish is the iconic cutthroat trout. It's a native North American fish that thrives in cold, small streams. Explorer Meriwether Lewis of Lewis and Clark Expedition fame was among the first European-Americans to catch this spangly, spotted fish. He used deer spleen as bait.
It's relative rarity now makes it a favorite for catch-and-release anglers. But biologists have now found that it's in danger. The much more common rainbow trout is invading cutthroat streams and mating with the native fish. Ecologist Clint Muhlfeld says that creates hybrids.
"It jumbles up the genes that are linked to the locally adapted traits that these fish have evolved with," says Muhlfeld, who's with the U.S. Geological Survey and the University of Montana's Flathead Lake Biological Station.
Those traits have allowed cutthroats to survive through millennia in cold northern streams. And cold streams were thought to protect them from rainbows, which prefer warmer water.
But climate change is warming many high-altitude streams, and they frequently have less water, another change that favors rainbows. So they're moving in.
Muhlfeld says that when rainbows and cutthroats breed, the resulting hybrids are feeble — "less fit," in biological terms. "They don't survive as well as the native fish," he says. And hybrids that do survive continue to make more hybrids; there's no going back to making cutthroats again.
Writing in the journal Global Change Biology, Muhlfeld and a team of scientists from several research institutions studied fish in hundreds of locations in the northern Rockies. Hybridization was widespread. It was most common in places where fish and game departments have introduced rainbow trout, a practice that goes back to the 19th century.
Some states are trying to solve the problem by getting rid of rainbow trout. That might not please some anglers, but Muhlfeld says the cutthroat species could disappear otherwise.
"There are so many places around the world where you can go catch a rainbow trout," he says; it's been introduced all over the world. "There's very few places where you can actually go and catch a native fish that's been around for thousands and thousands of years.
"Extinction is permanent. Once the native genomes and adaptive traits are gone, they are gone forever."

BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — Pekka Rinne stopped 35 shots for his eighth shutout of the season and the Nashville Predators set a franchise record by earning a point in their 15th consecutive game with a 4-0 win over the Buffalo Sabres on Monday night.
Mike Fisher and Ryan Johansen scored goals 4:34 apart in the second period, and Filip Forsberg and Ryan Hartman sealed the victory by scoring in the final four minutes.
The NHL-leading Predators improved to 14-0-1 in their past 15, and also extended their team-best road winning streak to nine straight.
Rinne won his 11th straight to match his personal best in a stretch in which he's allowed just 18 goals. The shutout was the 51st of his 12-year career and third in nine games.
And Rinne also improved to 40-9-4 in becoming the NHL's seventh goalie to win 40 games in a season three or more times.
The Predators haven't lost in regulation since a 3-1 defeat to Detroit at home on Feb. 17. And they improved to 12-0-3 in their past 15 road games since a 3-0 loss at Vegas on Jan. 2.
The Sabres were unable to build off a 5-3 win over Chicago on Saturday and lost in rookie coach Phil Housley's first meeting against his former team. The Hockey Hall of Fame defenseman spent the previous four seasons as a Predators assistant coach.
Buffalo ranks last in the Eastern Conference and had its NHL-worst home record drop to 11-21-5.
Minor-league call-up Linus Ullmark stopped 28 shots, starting in place of Robin Lehner, who was sidelined with an undisclosed injury.
Ullmark had little chance on Fisher's goal that opened the scoring 12:29 into the second period.
Fisher and teammate Scott Hartnell were both parked in front when Fisher deflected in Mikka Salomaki's shot from the blue line. The Sabres challenged the goal by arguing Fisher interfered with Ullmark. The goal was allowed to stand despite a replay showing Fisher nudged the back of Ullmark's skate in the crease and also got a hand on the goalie's glove.
There was no disputing Johansen's goal. Ullmark stopped Viktor Arvidsson's initial shot from the right circle. The rebound fell at Ullmark's his feet where Forsberg chipped the puck to Johansen, who snapped it in the open left side.
The first period was lively with both teams putting their speed on display.
Arvidsson nearly scored 7 seconds in on a breakaway off the opening faceoff.
Buffalo's Jack Eichel burst up the left side and behind the Predators defense to drive across the crease only to have his shot stopped by Rinne's left pad. Rinne also got an assist from Kevin Fiala who got his stick out to stop Justin Bailey's attempt to tap in a bouncing puck in the crease.
NOTES: Rinne joined a list of three-time 40-game winners led by former New Jersey goalie Martin Broduer, who reached the milestone eight times. Washington's Braden Holtby is the only other active goalie to win 40 games three times. The other three-time 40-game-winners were Terry Sawchuk, Jacques Plante, Mikka Kiprusoff and Evgeni Nabokov. ... Sabres RW Kyle Okposo returned after missing three games with a concussion. ... With 10 games left, the Predators inched closer to matching franchise records for most wins (51) and points (110) set in 2006-07.
UP NEXT
Predators: Host Toronto Maple Leafs on Thursday.
Sabres: Host Arizona Coyotes on Wednesday in matchup of NHL's two worst teams.

Police investigators are scheduled to question the Prime Minister at his official residence on Monday in connection with claims of corruption by Mr. Netanyahu.
The allegations, which relate to the alleged receipt of gifts by Netanyahu from businessmen in Israel and abroad, have been described by Israeli media outlets as extremely serious.
But authorities have volunteered little information on the investigation, and some have suggested the Israeli media is actively seeking to play up the inquiry in an effort to unseat the Prime Minister.
Prominent American Jewish jurist Alan Dershowitz told Israel Hayom in an interview published Sunday that Netanyahu should be granted temporary immunity from such investigations, to prevent the Israeli left and media from hobbling the government at such a critical time.
"[T]hey can't beat him through democratic means, so they're trying to use these investigations and the media to push him out of office. That would really undercut democracy. He's been elected by a proper method of election in Israel and he should be left to complete his term without interference. If there are issues they should be pursued after he leaves office.”
According to unconfirmed reports, police have asked the Prime Minister to set aside as much as four hours on Monday for questioning. Netanyahu has said he will cooperate with the police and grant as much time as needed, while pointing out he may be forced to leave later in the day for the funeral of former Justice Minister Yaakov Neeman.

A Bay Area woman who witnessed some of the violence that erupted Saturday in Charlottesville is speaking out about her experience."It was honestly a hard decision to be there," San Jose resident Kristin Savini said.Savini is still in disbelief over what she witnessed this weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia. She was visiting her daughter at medical school at the University of Virginia and knew about the protests, but was shocked when she came face to face with what she called hatred.It was difficult for Savini to distinguish white nationalists who came to rally from militia men who were heavily armed.Savini says the counter protesters outnumbered the white nationalists, but it was still scary to see the racist and anti-Semitic messages. "That was really disturbing, so surreal to see people actually burning torches," she said.At one point, she saw a car accelerate and head into a group of counter protesters."All of a sudden they just hit the gas and tore out into the group of people and they did hit one of the counter protestors that was close. He fell and popped right back up," Savini said.Fortunately, the one man who fell was not hurt. That incident happened a block away from the other car that rammed into protestors on Saturday, killing one woman and injuring more than a dozen others.Sivini says she returns home grateful that for the most part the Bay Area is a place where diversity and acceptance are celebrated.

A new malware campaign is making its way into businesses through a malicious PowerPoint email attachment, Trend Micro research has found. According to blog post, CVE-2017-0199 traditionally utilizes RTF documents, and this is the first time it has been seen to abuse PowerPoint Slide Show in the wild.
The malware comes in an email that appears to be from a company that manufactures cables. The email tells the recipient to see the order and asks for them to quote cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) and free on board (FOB) prices as well. Due to the targeted nature of the email, as the criminals are typically going after electronics companies, the post said, the email is being considered a spear phishing attack.
In the sample email provided by Trend Micro, the attachment is titled PO-483848.ppsx. In that case, PO could be short for purchase order, in an effort to increase the perceived legitimacy of the PowerPoint file.
SEE: 10 ways to minimize fileless malware infections
If the victim opens the attached file, there will be no purchase order, not even any fake text attempting to be one. It simply reads: CVE-2017-8570. That's the name of another Microsoft vulnerability, the post said, but not the one that this particular malware is targeting.
PowerPoint then initializes a script moniker and runs the malicious payload, the post said. If successful, it will download an XML file from the internet. Some JavaScript code in that XML file runs a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a remote access tool.
At this point, the attackers will be able to run remote commands on the victim's machine. "The tool's capabilities are quite comprehensive, and includes a download & execute command, a keylogger, a screen logger, and recorders for both webcam and microphone," the post said.
The biggest issue for this given attack is the fact that it comes by way of a PowerPoint file. Most current detection methods focus on the RTF delivery method, so that means attackers utilizing the PPSX files could have an easier time avoiding antivirus detection, the post said.
To protect against attacks like this one, businesses should make sure that their systems are properly patched and updated to account for any known vulnerabilities. Also, users should be regularly educated on proper security hygiene and email etiquette.
The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers
A new spear phishing campaign is using PowerPoint files to exploit the CVE-2017-0199 and deliver malware to victims. If a user clicks on the attached file, it will run a remote access tool, and could allow attackers access to a user's keystrokes, screen, webcam, and microphone. IT should keep systems update and educate users on the proper behavior regarding attachments and emails from outside parties.

The desperate search for the suspect or suspects who have put Austin residents on edge with a series of explosives is now likely focused on the few clues police have on hand.Fred Milanowski, a special agent in charge for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives who is on the ground in Austin, told ABC News that officials are looking at "a couple of people of interest" but added they are still actively calling for the public's help.The most obvious avenue for investigation at this point is examining the remnants of the four devices that have exploded in Austin over a 17-day span. The explosions have killed two people and injured four others."Every bomber leaves a signature because they tend to make their devices the same way every time 'cause once they've perfected one they don't want to take a chance of accidentally detonating something," Milanowski told ABC News.But since the first three blasts stemmed from package bombs and officials believe the fourth explosive, which went off on Sunday night, was detonated by a tripwire, it could suggest that the bombmaker or bombmakers are changing their style."That's why this one does concern us because it's got a little more sophisticated with this tripwire," Milanowski said."From preliminarily what we've seen in there, there's reason to believe that the same individual that built those built the other one," he said.John Cohen, a former acting Homeland Security under secretary and now an ABC News consultant, said that the leftovers from the physical bombs will play a key role in more ways than one. For example, there could be DNA left on a portion of the bomb, which authorities will then run through any number of records repositories, like criminal or military records as well as fingerprints from certain background checks or travel records like TSA PreCheck, that could match the bomb to a name."Even if they find DNA or fingerprints but they're not in those repositories, it won't help them identify the person, but it will help them connect the individual events to the same person," Cohen said.The level of sophistication in the bombs and the ability to make different types of bombs as seen in the switch to a tripwire could also be an avenue in and of itself.Steve Gomez, a former FBI special agent in charge and current ABC News consultant, stressed the level of craftsmanship on display in the bombs so far and the level of preparation that the bomber or bombers had to commit before detonating the blasts."Whoever is the suspect or suspects, they are very sophisticated when it comes to bombmaking and explosives, so that's the first line of investigations that they pursue," Gomez said, noting that "anyone in the area that has some kind of explosives-making experience" is likely going to be considered.Gomez said it's also clear that the suspect or suspects are "utilizing a lot of planning because so far there have been no videos that have come up with a potential suspect, which indicates that the bomber is probably doing surveillance of the locations where the bombs are going to be planted.""It's fairly easy to determine if somebody has visible cameras or the doorbell cameras -- those are fairly easy to detect -- so that might be part of the surveillance that the bomber is conducting," Gomez said.
Trump went on the counter-offensive as his administration reeled from the abrupt dismissal of Michael Flynn as national security adviser on Monday.
The New York Times reported late on Tuesday that phone call records and intercepted calls showed members of Trump's presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the Nov. 8 election.
Trump dismissed the report, firing back in a series of early morning tweets on Wednesday.
"This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign," the Republican president tweeted, citing his former Democratic rival in the 2016 presidential contest.
In another tweet, Trump said: "Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia," adding that the situation was "very serious."
"The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by "intelligence" like candy. Very un-American!" Trump wrote.
He did not give evidence to back his charge that intelligence officials were supplying information to the news media. He did not say if he had ordered any investigation into leaks.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the Times report, which the Kremlin dismissed on Wednesday.
CNN also reported that Trump advisers were in constant contact with Russian officials during the campaign.
The Times, citing current and former U.S. officials, said U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies intercepted the communications around the same time they discovered Russia was trying to disrupt the presidential election by hacking into the Democratic National Committee.
The officials had seen no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians on the hacking or other efforts to influence the election, the Times said, but they were still alarmed by the intercepted communications.
Flynn was forced out over conversations he had with the Russian ambassador before Trump took office on Jan. 20, and his misrepresentations to Vice President Mike Pence over what he had discussed.
The Times said the intercepted calls in its report were different from the wiretapped conversations between Flynn and the ambassador, Sergei Kislyak.
U.S. lawmakers, including some leading Republicans, called on Tuesday for a deeper inquiry into not just Flynn's actions but broader White House ties to Russia. Trump has long said that he would like improved relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Flynn's conversations with the Russian ambassador took place around the time that then-President Barack Obama imposed new sanctions on Russia on Dec. 29, charging that Moscow had used cyber attacks to try to influence the presidential election in Trump's favor.
A U.S. official familiar with the transcripts of the calls with the ambassador said Flynn indicated that if Russia did not retaliate, that could smooth the way toward a broader discussion of improving U.S.-Russian relations once Trump took power.
This was potentially illegal under a law barring unauthorized private citizens from interfering in disputes the United States has with other countries.
Fruitcake is known to stay fresh for an inordinate amount of time.
But Antarctic conservators say they recently came upon a specimen that tests the limits of the treat: a 106-year-old cake, found in one of Antarctica's first buildings.
This particular cake is believed to have been brought over in 1910 during the Terra Nova expedition of Robert Falcon Scott. According to the Antarctic Heritage Trust, "it has been documented that Scott took this particular brand of cake with him at that time."
The Huntley & Palmers fruitcake was wrapped in paper and housed in a tin-plated iron alloy tin, which is showing signs of deterioration. However, the cake itself is "well-preserved," the conservators say.
"There was a very, very slight rancid butter smell to it, but other than that, the cake looked and smelled edible!" the Trust's Programme Manager-Artefacts Lizzie Meek said in a statement. "There is no doubt that the extreme cold in Antarctica has assisted its preservation."
The century-old dessert was found with nearly 1,500 other artifacts from two huts at Cape Adare.
According to the Trust, the first buildings on the continent "were built by Norwegian Carsten Borchgrevink's expedition in 1899 and later used by Captain Scott's party in 1911." Meek says the team members were finishing up their work collecting objects when they were surprised to find the old dessert.
She adds that even present day explorers love a good fruitcake: "It's an ideal high-energy food for Antarctic conditions, and is still a favorite item on modern day trips to the ice."
The cake's sheer density probably helps. As NPR's Maria Godoy has reported, people doing outdoor work in the Antarctic need about 5,000 calories a day — and more like 6,500 if you're involved in manhauling, which is "pulling sleds across the ice and snow with their bodies."
Maria writes that there's one clear lesson that Antarctic explorers have learned over the years: "When life is stripped down to man versus the most brutal elements, bring plenty of snacks."
This is something Scott's team knew — in fact, Maria says that "his party conducted a study that suggested a high-carb, high-fat diet to be optimal for the harsh climes."
But tragically, explorers on Antarctic expeditions were often hungry. Scott himself starved to death while on the return journey from the South Pole.
The objects recovered from Cape Adare — including a watercolor painting of a Tree Creeper bird by scientist Edward Wilson — are undergoing conservation treatment and will be returned there, because the huts are deemed an Antarctic Specially Protected Area. That will happen after restoration work is finished on the buildings themselves.
WASHINGTON (AP) — With the government's budget deficit rising, the Treasury Department announced Monday that it expects to borrow $441 billion in the current January-March quarter, the largest amount in eight years.
The Treasury said this figure compares to actual borrowing of $282 billion in the October-December quarter. It will be the largest borrowing need since the government borrowed $483 billion in the January-March quarter of 2010, a period when the government was using stimulus spending to try to lift the country out of the Great Recession and provide support to the banking system after the worst financial crisis in seven decades.
The government's borrowing needs have been rising as federal deficits have increased. The deficit for the 2017 budget year, which ended last September, totaled $665.8 billion.
Private forecasters believe this year's deficit will climb to around $765 billion, and some are forecasting deficits for next year could once again top $1 trillion. Those projections reflect growing costs for Social Security and Medicare as the baby boom generation retires and the costs of the big tax cut that President Donald Trump pushed through Congress last month, a package estimated to boost deficits by $1.5 trillion over the next decade.
To cope with the higher borrowing needs, Treasury has asked Congress to raise the borrowing limit, which is currently $20.5 trillion. The government has continued borrowing money during the impasse but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's will run out of room to use various bookkeeping maneuvers to stay under the current debt limit probably by early March.
Treasury on Wednesday will release the specific details of what types of securities it plans to sell this quarter to meet its borrowing needs.
NEW YORK (AP) — The latest on developments in financial markets (All times local):
9:35 a.m.
Stocks are opening solidly higher on Wall Street after a number of big U.S. companies reported strong quarterly earnings.
Boeing jumped 6 percent in early trading Wednesday. The aerospace giant has been the biggest gainer in the Dow Jones industrial average over the past year.
Xerox rose 10.5 percent after reporting a strong quarter of its own. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices rose 4.7 percent and Electronic Arts rose 8.6 percent.
The early gains recovered some of the ground the market lost a day earlier, when it had its biggest drop since August.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 15 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,837.
The Dow rose 238 points, or 0.9 percent, to 26,318. The Nasdaq climbed 48 points, or 0.7 percent, to 7,451.
NEW YORK (AP) — New York City's deadly helicopter crash has prompted the National Transportation Safety Board to call on federal regulators to prohibit commercial flights that use passenger harness systems that do not allow for easy release.
The NTSB's recommendation on Monday comes after last week's helicopter crash in the East River. Five passengers who couldn't free themselves from their harnesses drowned. The pilot escaped.
The Federal Aviation Administration on Friday temporarily grounded open-door flights involving restraints that cannot be quickly released. It also said it was conducting a review of its rules governing such flights.
NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt applauds the agency's move, but says "definitive action needs to be taken."
FAA spokesman Greg Martin says the grounding was a first step and that more formal action is expected.
FARGO, N.D. (AP) — A North Dakota woman pleaded guilty Monday in the killing of a pregnant neighbor so she and her boyfriend could keep the baby, though officials remained tight-lipped about how the victim died.
Brooke Crews, 38, could face life in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit kidnapping and murder and lying to law officers in the death of 22-year-old Savanna Greywind, of Fargo. Her boyfriend, William Hoehn, 32, has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit kidnapping and murder and lying to law officers. He is scheduled for trial in March.
Crews' attorney, Steven Mottinger, said afterward that the guilty pleas will help his client argue for less than the maximum sentence of life in prison without parole.
"Ms. Crews early on indicated that she wanted to take responsibility for her actions," Mottinger said. "From where I stand, she took responsibility today by entering a guilty plea to the three charges."
Greywind was eight months pregnant when she disappeared in August. Kayakers found her body wrapped in plastic in a river. The baby was found alive in the apartment Crews shared with her 32-year-old boyfriend, William Hoehn. Hoehn is scheduled for trial in March.
Crews didn't offer details on how Greywind was killed. Authorities haven't said either, but Fargo Police Chief Dave Todd has said her death was a "cruel and vicious act of depravity."
Cass County State's Attorney Birch Burdick said further details aren't likely to be released until after Hoehn's case is finished.
"As you're well aware, this is one important step in two cases that are intertwined," Burdick said outside the courtroom. "At least our office will be rather circumspect until we've got both cases resolved. Then we can elaborate more fully."
Crews initially claimed that Greywind gave up her newborn daughter, but she later admitted taking advantage of the woman to get the child, according to court documents. Crews told police she arranged to have Greywind come to her apartment and told her how to induce labor. Greywind came back two days later to give her the newborn baby, Crews said.
But Hoehn told police a different story, according to the documents. He said he came home on Aug. 19 to find Crews cleaning up blood in their bathroom. Hoehn said Crews presented him with an infant girl and said: "This is our baby. This is our family."
Hoehn told police he took garbage bags containing bloody shoes and his bloody towels and disposed them away from the apartment complex, according to the court documents. Hoehn is scheduled for trial in March.
The baby is now in the custody of her father, Ashton Matheny, who was Greywind's boyfriend.
East Central District Judge Frank Racek on Monday asked Crews about letters she sent to the court complaining about a delay in receiving evidence. Crews told the judge that the issue was resolved.
"Cases like this we start with initial police reports, lab reports," Mottinger said. "Things come in over a period of time. It's a step by step by process."

#BREAKING #Oakland nurse Maria Mendoza Sanchez, about to be deported after 20 yrs in country. Message to @POTUS pic.twitter.com/aVFmQlanCM — Laura Anthony (@LauraAnthony7) August 14, 2017
With just one day to go before Maria Mendoza Sanchez and husband Eusebio must leave the country, the Highland Hospital cancer nurse made a direct appeal to President Donald Trump , one parent to another."One of the things I admire about him s that he is a loving father, " said Sanchez, standing amid supporters in front of Highland. "He loves his kids very much and his grandchildren too. I just him to realize how would he feel if all of a sudden something would happen to Ivanka."The Sanchez' were surrounded by other healthcare workers and supporters at a rally demanding the couple be allowed to stay in the United States. "We have to show the world and this country that there's no such thing as an illegal human," said Josie Camacho with the Alameda Labor Council. "We have families here, we have mothers... we have nurses."Last Thursday, U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein met with the Sanchez family at their East Oakland home.Feinstein and U.S. Senator Kamala Harris are both working behind the scenes to try to persuade ICE, Immigration, and Customs Enforcement, to stop deportation proceedings.The government first began trying to deport them in 2002, but since they had jobs, paid taxes and stayed out of legal trouble, the Obama Administration let them stay on a year to year basis. The Trump administration has put a stop to that. They have four children, three of them U.S. citizens.Last week, ICE issued the following statement: "The courts consistently held that neither of these individuals has a legal basis to remain in the U.S. While ICE continues to prioritize its enforcement resources to focus on individuals who pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security, ICE will not exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement.""There are a lot of good people out there," said Maria Mendoza-Sanchez. "They're good people. They deserve the chance to be given the opportunity to be here and make a difference for this country."As it is now, the couple is set to fly to Mexico Tuesday afternoon with their 12-year-old son. Three older daughters will stay behind in the Bay Area.
NEW YORK (AP) — Sarah Jessica Parker is adding another credit to her life as a bookworm.
The “Sex and the City” actress is serving as honorary chair of the American Library Association’s newly created Book Club Central. The library association told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the club will recommend books throughout the year and will formally launch in Chicago on June 24, during the ALA’s annual conference.
“From an early age, books were my constant companions and my local library a place I could find a new friend on every shelf,” Parker said in a statement. “I’m thrilled to help champion original voices for dedicated readers as well as for a new generation, supporting libraries in what they do best.”
Parker recently started her own imprint with Penguin Random House and last year introduced J.K. Rowling at a PEN gala, where the “Harry Potter” author was being honored by the literary and human rights organization. Parker also served on a presidential arts and humanities committee during the Obama administration.

The fishing inshore has slowed a little as the clearer water has moved into the area. This makes catching bait a little more challenging. Still we are catching roosterfish, but not on every trip. There are patches of sardines moving in and finding these has given us some fun top water fishing. The offshore is getting good and we have some nice billfish action less than 25 miles out.
For the next couple of months, we expect more and more sardines to make their way into the gulf and along the coast. This drags with it a host of predators like snappers, seabass (corvina), rainbow runners, skipjack tuna, mackerel, jacks and roosterfish. This makes for excellent top water action. The jigging on the rocks usually picks up with jacks, seabass, snappers and amberjack making up most of the catch. The roosterfish are scarcer, but it is the time of the year when the big boys are caught. The key is having good bait.
Offshore should remain good with sailfish being the main catch. Marlin, tuna and mahi should also be around in smaller numbers. Tight lines to all!

ALBANY, N.Y. (CBSNewYork/AP) — New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has blocked New York City Council’s fee on non-reusable shopping bags just hours before it was supposed to take effect.
Cuomo on Tuesday approved a measure forbidding the city from placing any fees on disposable shopping bags until at least next year. The state Assembly and Senate both voted to block the 5-cent fee last week.
Cuomo called the fee “deeply flawed” because it would allow store owners to keep the profit.
“Most objectionable is that the law was drafted so that merchants keep the five cent fee as profit, instead of the money being used to solve the problem of plastic bags’ environmental impact – essentially amounting to a $100 million per year windfall to merchants,” the governor said in a statement.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had championed the bag fee as a way to reduce litter and protect the environment.
Critics say overruling the city is an example of government overreach.
“As a proud supporter of the city’s Bring Your Own Bag Law and a city government veteran, I have to say: I’ve seen too many good ideas killed in Albany. I’m disappointed by this latest attack on the city’s home rule authority and the governor’s decision not to veto it,” Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer said in a statement. “That said, I’m encouraged that Gov. Cuomo is committing to take on this issue statewide.”
Cuomo announced a task force to address the environmental impact of plastic bags by the end of the year.

A senior White House official declared on Tuesday night that the United States would no longer insist on a “two-state solution” to the Israeli-Palestinian Authority (PA) conflict.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the United States would not seek to dictate the terms of any eventual peace settlement, but would support what the two sides agree to together.
NEW YORK (AP) — The actors from HBO's limited series "Big Little Lies" will have quite an internal competition at the Golden Globes next month.
Powerhouse actresses Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon are both nominated for best actress for a limited TV series, while colleagues Laura Dern, Shailene Woodley and Alexander Skarsgard are up for supporting awards. The Globes announced their television nominations on Monday, and the HBO series led the way with six nods.
The Globes offered 32 nominations for programs from cable networks, led by HBO's dozen. Streaming services had 15 nominations, with Netflix on top with nine. The only broadcast networks with nominations were NBC, with five, and ABC, with three.
CBS, the most-watched network on television, was shut out.
While the Fox network also came up empty, its cable cousin FX was second only to HBO among the cable networks with eight nominations. They include Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon, stars of "Feud: Bette and Joan."
Netflix's "The Crown" and "Stranger Things" are both up for best drama series. HBO's "Game of Thrones" and Hulu's "The Handmaid's Tale" are also up for best drama, with NBC's "This is Us" carrying the flag for broadcast television.
"The Good Doctor," ABC's series about an autistic doctor and the biggest new broadcast hit, didn't land in the top five, although lead actor Freddie Highmore will compete for best drama actor.
"Veep" and star Julia Louis-Dreyfus are used to picking up fistfuls of Emmy awards, but they can stay home on Golden Globes night — one of the most notable snubs in the comedy category.
In a retro touch, NBC's reboot of "Will & Grace" was nominated for best comedy or musical, with star Eric McCormack earning a nod for best actor. ABC's "black-ish" and star Anthony Anderson will be among the competition.
Netflix's "Master of None" and Showtime's "Smilf" will also compete for best comedy, along with one relative surprise contender in Amazon's "The Amazing Mrs. Maisel," about a housewife turned comic from "Gilmore Girls" creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. Globe voters may be looking to lift the series from obscurity, since "Maisel" star Rachel Brosnahan was also nominated.
Along with Highmore, best drama actor nominees include Jason Bateman of "Ozark," Sterling K. Brown of "This is Us," Bob Odenkirk of "Better Call Saul" and Liev Schreiber of "Ray Donovan."
New series are emphasized in the best actress category, where the nominees include Caitriona Balfe of "Outlander," Claire Foy of "The Crown," Maggie Gyllenhaal of "The Deuce," Katherine Langford of "13 Reasons Why" and Elisabeth Moss of "The Handmaid's Tale."
Two prominent shows where actors were recently written out due to sexual misconduct allegations — "House of Cards" (Kevin Spacey) and "Transparent" (Jeffrey Tambor) — were both shut out of nominations. It's unknown whether the controversy had any impact; the Globes tend to favor new work and both these series are no longer novelties.
SEATTLE (AP) — A man who accused Seattle Mayor Ed Murray of sexually abusing him when he was a teenager has asked a court to dismiss the lawsuit he filed against the mayor.
"Delvonn Heckard is only delaying his lawsuit until the mayor is out of power," his lawyer, Lincoln Beauregard, said Wednesday on Twitter.
In a motion filed Tuesday, Beauregard said Heckard feels it would be wise to complete his extensive counseling and recovery before moving forward with the case.
He said in the motion that Heckard determined it would be better for the success of the case and the citizens of Seattle if it went forward after Murray was out of office next year.
In an email to The Associated Press Wednesday, the lawyer said, "we look forward to winning."
Murray, who has denied the allegation, dropped his re-election bid because of the lawsuit that claimed he paid Heckard for sex in the 1980s.
A spokesman for Murray didn't immediately respond to a request Wednesday for comment.
Murray has said it was better for the city if he didn't run for a second term.
His lawyers, Malaika Eaton and Robert Sulkin, filed a motion on May 24 saying the lawsuit should be dismissed.
They argued that Heckard had failed to state a legitimate claim and that his sex-abuse claims are barred by Washington's statute of limitations. They also said Murray should be reimbursed for legal costs.
Heckard's lawsuit, filed in April, claims Murray paid Heckard, now a 46-year-old suburban Seattle man, for sex three decades ago.
Two other men claimed in interviews with The Seattle Times that Murray abused them in the 1980s when they lived in an Oregon center for troubled children. They were not part of the Heckard lawsuit.
The suit was filed as Murray became a high-profile critic of President Donald Trump. At the time, Murray spokesman Jeff Reading said the case was politically motivated and timed to derail the mayor's re-election bid.
Beauregard's motion claims Murray's lawyers and his former campaign team "have successfully tainted the jury pool with false information about the accusers." A judge previously rejected Beauregard's request to move the trial out of the city.
The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are a victim of sex abuse, but Heckard has said he wanted his name made public.
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel is preparing to extradite a 63-year-old citizen to the United States, where he is wanted on suspicion of killing his mother.
The state prosecution says Monday it has asked the court to declare Thomas Joseph Gross fit for extradition. The American extradition request says Gross travelled to Florida in 2012 to visit his mother. The night before his return to Israel he allegedly drugged her and stabbed her to death in her car outside her Lakewood Ranch home. The next morning he called 911, saying he had found her body, and tried to portray the scene as a suicide or robbery gone wrong.
Gross' Israeli lawyer says he was previously questioned and released by authorities and the extradition is a shaming attempt by his sister over an inheritance battle.
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — The Latest on calls for California's public pension fund to stop investing in assault-weapon retailers (all times local):
12 p.m.
The father of a 27-year-old woman who died in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, is calling on the nation's largest public pension fund to stop investing in companies that sell assault weapons.
Robert Velasco says action by California's public pension board can "send a powerful message" to lawmakers who have failed to act after mass shootings nationwide.
Velasco is one of several relatives of San Bernardino shooting victims who are testifying before the California Public Employees' Retirement System board. The pension fund says four of the five companies it invests in that sell guns have decided to stop selling assault weapons.
Renee Wetzel, whose husband died in the 2015 attack, is imploring the board to "use his memory to make a change."
Also testifying are California alumni of the Florida high school where 17 people were killed last month.

8 a.m.
California State Treasurer John Chiang is calling on the nation's largest public pension fund to stop investing in companies that sell assault-style weapons and devices that allow guns to fire more rapidly.
Chiang will speak Monday at a board meeting of the California Public Employees' Retirement System alongside family members of victims of the 2015 terror attack in San Bernardino, California, that killed 14 people.
The wife of a high school teacher who died in Parkland, Florida, sent a letter supporting Chiang's effort. Chiang, a Democrat, is running for governor.
CalPERS has a combined roughly $850 in million holdings in five companies that sell such guns or devices: Dick's Sporting Goods, Walmart, Kroger, Big 5 Sporting Goods and Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings. The fund's total value is $354 billion.
A fireworks retailer in Missouri went up in flames on the eve of Fourth of July.Firefighters responded to a major fire at AM Pyrotechnics in Pleasant Hope, Missouri, on Tuesday night, according to Springfield, Missouri, ABC affiliate KSPR . According to the affiliate, several explosions rocked the building, and were large enough to rattle neighbors' windows.One person suffered "moderate" injuries, according to KSPR.Pleasant Hope is about 20 miles north of Springfield.The building was entirely destroyed by the explosions and fire.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has reported to the scene, according to the Kansas City ATF branch. Considered an explosive, ATF regulates fireworks in the country.KSPR reported AM Pyrotechnics was a distributor of fireworks to companies putting on large displays as opposed to selling fireworks to individuals.Fireworks are legal for sale in Missouri, with wholesalers being able to sell year-round, while those who apply for seasonal permits can sell fireworks from June 20 to July 10, according to state law
TAIPEI (Taiwan News) -- In another challenge match allegedly meant to test the effectiveness of traditional martial arts versus modern mixed martial arts (MMA), gym owner Xu Xiaodong (徐曉冬) on Sunday (March 18) easily pummeled an obscure martial artist who claimed to be a "4th generation descendant of Yip Man," Bruce Lee's master.
At the opening of the 3-minute bout, the alleged "Wing Chun" practitioner, identified as Ding Hao (丁浩), launched a flurry of rapid Wing-Chun-like punches, however Xu simply shrugged them off and quickly hurled Ding to the turf. The referee then separated the two fighters as ground fighting was apparently not allowed this time around.
For the rest of the fight, Xu easily punched and tossed Ding to the ground for a total of six times, each time with the referee leaping in dramatic fashion to protect him. Despite the fact that Ding was dazed, bloodied and confused at the end, the referee bizarrely declared the lopsided affair a "tie."
The match was a sequel to a bout which took place between Xu and an equally obscure "Tai Chi master" (who is a massage therapist by day) in April of last year, during which Xu made even quicker work of the timid "Tai Chi" practitioner and quickly triggered a nationwide backlash by Chinese who felt that he was disrespecting traditional Chinese culture.
Xu's blanket claims that all traditional Chinese martial arts are fake and his gloating over his swift dispatch of the massage therapist angered millions of netizens and countless Chinese martial artists, who rapidly began lining up to challenge him, well before any cash prize was announced.
Such outcomes are to be expected as the fighting applications of many traditional martial arts have been lost since the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) seized power in 1949 and began to systematically eradicate Chinese traditional culture. A large number of martial artists were imprisoned or even executed, a process which was accelerated during the Cultural Revolution.
After eliminating most traditional martial arts, the CCP introduced modernized wushu (武術, martial arts) and simplified tai chi, removing the spiritual and martial aspects of the arts, while adding gymnastic skills to more closely resemble Olympic gymnastic floor routines or acrobat performances.
Contrary to Xu's statements, kung fu practitioners who have kept the fighting tradition alive outside of China have actually excelled in MMA, including notable fighters such as Cung Le (who has already called Xu out), Peter Davis, Pat Barry, and Roy Nelson, all of whom have winning records in the cage. UFC fighter Roy Nelson started his martial arts training with the Lohan School of Shaolin in Las Vegas and still trains in kung fu on a daily basis.

Autonomous transportation has been a subject of science fiction for decades, but it's quickly becoming reality, with companies such as Ford and Domino's Pizza being some of the latest to get into the action in interesting new ways. This month's special report from ZDNet and TechRepublic, Tech and the Future of Transportation, looks at how the rise of autonomous transportation will affect businesses and employees.
You can download all of the stories as a free PDF ebook (free registration required).
There are many obstacles to overcome before autonomous vehicles go mainstream, and writer Conner Forrest examined those, including liability in case of accidents, insurance coverage, and fear caused by high-profile mishaps.
Diving further into the safety issue, writer Teena Maddox reported on the ability of autonomous vehicles to save lives by eliminating accidents caused by human error.
Looking at the current business landscape, writer Alison DeNisco reported on research that named the 10 leading companies in the autonomous vehicle space. Some relatively unknown companies made the list, and some of the usual suspects like Tesla, Uber, and Apple were absent.
TechRepublic's global editor in chief Jason Hiner delved into the massive disruptions that could be unleashed by hyperloop.
This feature also contains original research from Tech Pro Research, a joint venture from ZDNet and TechRepublic. That report details predictions from 289 professionals about how autonomous transportation will affect their industries, companies, and personal lives.

LLEIDA, Spain (AP) — Clashes have erupted between police and protesters in Spain's northeastern Catalan city of Lleida after a judicial ruling ordered the city's museum to return 44 pieces of religious art to the neighboring regional government of Aragon.
Regional police cordoned off the area around Lleida Museum early Monday as technicians prepared to remove the disputed artwork.
Several hundred people turned up to protest the transfer and there were brief scuffles and police baton charges as officers tried to move them further away from the museum.
An Aragon provincial court had given till Monday for the museum to hand over the art — which was originally housed in the region's Sijena monastery — following a 2015 court ruling.
Catalonia bought the art from nuns in 1983 but the court ruled the sale illegal.

WYOMING, Ohio (AP) — The father of an American college student who was imprisoned in North Korea and was returned to his home state of Ohio in a coma says the family is “adjusting to a different reality.”
Fred Warmbier told Fox News’ Tucker Carlson on Wednesday that his son, Otto, was “terrorized and brutalized” during his 17-month detention and has been in a coma for more than a year.
“The day after he was sentenced, he went into a coma,” the father said in an interview scheduled to air Thursday night. He said he and his wife, Cindy, only learned of their son’s condition last week.
The 22-year-old University of Virginia student was medically evacuated from North Korea and arrived in Cincinnati late Tuesday. He was then taken by ambulance to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. A hospital spokeswoman did not provide an update on his condition, but said his parents planned to hold a Thursday morning news conference.
Their public appearance will be at Wyoming High School, one of Ohio’s top-rated schools. Warmbier graduated from there in 2013 as class salutatorian and had played soccer.
Residents of the northern Cincinnati suburb tied blue-and-white ribbons, the school colors, to trees near the family’s home. Joy at his release was mixed with concern over his condition.
Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said there should be an investigation into what happened to Warmbier leading to this “tragic situation.”
Richardson, a Democrat, credited the Department of State with securing Warmbier’s return from North Korea without any preconditions but said a forceful response from the U.S. government would be required “if its determined that there was a cover-up and Otto’s condition was not disclosed and he didn’t get proper treatment.”
City councilwoman Jenni McCauley said the tight-knit community was “thrilled” to have Warmbier back.
“Even though they’re saddened by his condition, they’re just glad for the family that he is home,” McCauley said. “For any parent, this is their worst nightmare. … We’re hoping that he will be OK.”
Warmbier was serving a 15-year prison term with hard labor in North Korea after he tearfully confessed that he tried to steal a propaganda banner while visiting the country.
Such detentions in the totalitarian nation have added to tensions between Washington and Pyongyang. Three Americans remain in custody.
The U.S. government accuses North Korea of using such detainees as political pawns. North Korea accuses Washington and South Korea of sending spies to overthrow its government.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Tuesday that his department was continuing “to have discussions” with North Korea about the release of the other three imprisoned American citizens.
When asked by Fox News what he would tell the families of those detained, Fred Warmbier said, “I wouldn’t know what to say to them. This is, I’ve been told, not precedented.”

Keith Carradine has had a storied career in Hollywood. The longtime actor and musician won an Oscar for his song “I’m Easy” from the 1976 movie Nashville worked alongside stars such as Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig and is going into his fourth season as President Conrad Dalton on the CBS hit political drama Madam Secretary. Carradine has been a part of many great TV shows and movies, but he says nothing compares to his experience on Madam Secretary
“Tea Leoni is the best of the best, she sets the tone for everyone,” Carradine told CBS Local. “I’m so happy to come to work and do the work. The work gets done efficiently, but joyfully. We are presenting political people and public servants in a light that we would like to see things be.”
Carradine’s ties with CBS run deep, as he’s also been a recurring character on The Big Bang Theory, where he plays Penny Hofstadter’s father Wyatt. While the Oscar winner is not known his comedic background, the writers of the show have ensured that Carradine leaves the audience laughing.
“Big Bang Theory is one of the best formats imaginable for an actor.” “I love to do comedy. It’s not necessarily what I’m known for, but when you walk into that environment they are going to make you funny.”
Carradine was always destined for the screen as both his father and his brother were in the business. While the co-star of ‘Madam Secretary,’ has a long list of credits, he knows winning an Oscar will always define him.
“It was an amazing moment, it was kind of an out of body experience to be told I had won and be handed that statue by Angie Dickinson and Burt Bacharach. Angie and I have remained friends ever since. It was extraordinary and unexpected.”

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — College basketball played an entire season amid a federal corruption investigation that magnified long-simmering troubles within the sport, from shady agent dealings to concerns over athletes who'd rather go straight to the pros.
Now it's time to hear new ideas on how to fix the complex, wide-ranging problems.
On Wednesday morning, the commission headed by former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will present its proposed reforms to university presidents of the NCAA Board of Governors and the Division I Board of Directors at the NCAA headquarters in Indianapolis. And that starts what could be a complicated process in getting changes adopted and implemented for next season.
"I expect the proposals will be strong," NCAA president Mark Emmert told The Associated Press. "They'll certainly break with the status quo. That's their charge and their mission. That's what we need.
"I think it's going to be a very good day for college sports," he said.
That would be welcome, considering there has been no shortage of bad days in recent months.
The Commission on College Basketball formed in October , a few weeks after federal prosecutors announced they had charged 10 men — including assistant coaches at Arizona, Auburn, USC and Oklahoma State along with a top Adidas executive — in a fraud and bribery scandal.
The case involves hundreds of thousands of dollars in alleged bribes and kickbacks designed to influence recruits on choosing a school, agent or apparel company. And it has entangled schools such as Kansas, North Carolina State , Louisville and Miami , among others, though prosecutors withdrew a criminal complaint in Feburary against one of the defendants, a youth hoops program director.
Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner John Swofford said that case has put college sports in the position of reacting instead of proactively heading off yet-to-emerge problems.
"Sometimes unfortunately that's what it takes," Swofford told the AP. "You'd like to think that collectively the basketball world could've seen this coming and had the foresight to get out ahead of it. But that's not reality. Organizations and people, we all sometimes need wake-up calls. And I see this as a wake-up call, and therefore an opportunity."
One the Rice commission wants to seize.
It was charged with finding ways to reform and modernize rules, including looking at the NCAA's relationship with the NBA, youth leagues, apparel companies and agents. It was also set to review an enforcement process that frequently takes years to resolve complicated cases of potentially major rules violations.
The commission features several prominent names in the sport, including former NBA stars Grant Hill and David Robinson, former Georgetown coach John Thompson III, retired college coach Mike Montgomery and Ohio State athletic director Gene Smith.
"The stage is set, certainly, given what's happened with law enforcement and what we've seen in media reports around men's basketball at the collegiate level," Southeastern Conference commissioner Greg Sankey told the AP. "You involve Condoleezza Rice because you want an impactful outcome."
After Rice presents Wednesday morning, the boards will meet to consider adopting the commission's recommendations, either fully or in part. The next stop would be the Division I Council, a group mostly made up of athletic directors, to craft legislation for implementation.
Emmert said the council is already forming subgroups to deal with the targeted areas the commission is expected to address, with the goal of having legislation ready to be presented by August in time for next season.
Swofford, for one, said he'd prefer to end the one-and-done model of top NBA prospects arriving in college for one-year pit stops before turning professional, though that would also take agreement from the NBA. Swofford prefers a model similar to baseball by allowing high schoolers to go straight to the pros but require players who enter college to spend two years there.
He'd also like to see the NBA-run G League become a stronger developmental option for athletes who don't want to come to college, a path recently chosen by former Syracuse recruit and McDonald's All-American Darius Bazley.
Regardless, Swofford said, changes must be broad-based because "I don't think there's a silver bullet here" to fix everything. And he expects the commission to offer "substantive" findings.
"If we can't react to something like this in a way that brings significant improvement to the system and to what we're doing, shame on us," Swofford said.

SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Frankie Ferrari had 19 points and Jordan Ratinho scored 17 to help San Francisco beat Santa Clara 70-59 on Saturday night.
Ferrari and Ratinho combined to shoot 14 of 23 from the field, including 4 of 7 from 3-point range. Matt McCarthy added 12 points on 6-of-9 shooting for USF (13-12, 5-7 West Coast Conference).
The Dons used runs of 14-4 and 9-0 to open a 14-point first-half lead before going into the break with a 35-23 advantage. KJ Feagin scored 11 points, and Henrik Jadersten scored the final six, in a 19-5 spurt that made it 42-all with 14 minutes to play, but Ratinho answered with a 3 and then made a layup to push the lead back to five points. Feagin's layup trimmed Santa Clara's deficit to 58-57 with five minutes left, but Ferrari countered with a 3-point play and the Broncos made just 1 of 10 from the field from there.
Feagin had 15 points, and Henry Caruso scored 12, for Santa Clara (8-16, 5-7).
USF shot 55 percent from the field and outrebounded the Broncos 34-21.

Water-skiers brave rain, cold for Lake Norman tournament
MICHELLE T. BERNARD
Staff Writer
It would have taken a more than a rainy day to stop competitors and spectators from traveling to the Lake Norman Marina on New Year’s Day to attend what has become one of the longest-running barefoot waterskiing tournaments in the country. About the only thing that would have cancelled it would have been ice on the water or if it was raining too hard that the boat driver couldn’t see properly, according to organizer John Gillette. Luckily, the heavy rain held off until the event was almost over.
There were three divisions open for competitors – men, open men (those who have won the event in the past) and the “boom” division, which is for beginners who hold on to a pole extended from a boat and ski. No female competitors entered this year. This competition is unique because it combines the individual’s start method with the number of seconds he remains skiing and the number of tricks he performs, according to Gillette.
Several competitors came from New Jersey and others came from Florida and Ohio to compete, including Daniel “Sparky” Wicks from New Jersey.
“Two years ago I came for the first time, got lucky somehow and won,” he said with a laugh. “Barefoot skiing is a lot of fun and an addiction.”
John Cornish, who splits his time between Pennsylvania and South Carolina, attended the event for the first time this year. Cornish is a legend in the sport and has been involved in barefoot skiing since its onset in 1978.
“We used to make our own canvas shorts and used handles that we didn’t even know if they’d hold together,” he said. “Now we have wet suits and the state-of-the-art equipment we have now. There’s still a bunch of diehards out here – a lot of us are old guys but it’s really fun.”
The event was judged by Rachel George Norman, a five-time world barefoot champion who is about to be inducted into the Water Skiing Hall of Fame.
Even though the competitors skied barefoot, Lake Norman Marina donated $.10 per point scored by all contestants to Samaritan’s Feet. Samaritan’s Feet provides shoes for the 1.5 billion people who are infected with diseases transmitted through contaminated soil due to lack of proper shoes. Last year, the event raised $1,000, which was enough to buy 75 pairs of shoes. The total amount donated this year was not available by press time.
In the men’s division, John Cornish won first place with 343 points, Wayne King placed second with 324 points and Mark Dougherty placed third with 269 points
In the open division, Jeff Blair was first with 785 points, Logan Walter second with 426 points and Marc Donahue third with 375 points
For the boom division, Lincoln County resident Alex Wulfhorst won first with 53 points, Hudson Fox as second with 52 points and Will Blair third with 44 points.

CLEVELAND (AP) — Browns safety Damarious Randall underestimated two things: the power of social media and passion of Cleveland fans.
Randall said Wednesday he never imagined that an innocent Twitter posting about the NBA Finals would blow up into a national story — and maybe something he lives to regret.
A big fan of Golden State star guard Stephen Curry, Randall posted a tweet on Monday night promising that if the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Warriors in the "2018 NBA finals, I'll buy everyone who retweet's this a jersey."
By Wednesday afternoon, Randall's tweet had been retweeted 869,000 times.
"Honestly, I didn't think it was going to get over 100," Randall said after practice. "I didn't think people were going to actually view that as a serious tweet from me. But obviously it got the whole world excited about it, and I mean now I'm actually excited about it. It is a great, great opportunity to interact with the fans and we're just going to watch the series and just see how everything folds out."
Randall, who came to the Browns in a March trade from Green Bay, said he couldn't track the number of re-tweets because his phone locked up when he tried to access his Twitter account.
"I definitely didn't think it would go as viral as it did," the 25-year-old said. "I definitely didn't think the Cleveland fan base would go this crazy about it. Obviously, it was a joke, but just to know how passionate this fan base is, I mean, it's just really encouraging."
Randall wouldn't say if he planned to pay off his promise if the Cavs win.
"We'll talk about this after the series is over," he said.
Randall is from Florida, but said he became a fan of Curry's after the shooting star made a name for himself at Davidson College and went pro. Randall said he also likes Cleveland's superstar LeBron James, but not as much as Curry.
"I am not anti-LeBron. I am actually a big LeBron fan as well, but when he's going against Steph, I would rather Steph over LeBron," he said. "But at the end of the day, I mean they are both great, great players, and I definitely respect everything that LeBron has done for this community and for this city and state. He is one of the greatest players to ever touch a basketball if you ask me."
Browns quarterback Tyrod Taylor had some advice for Randall when it comes to picking sides and making your opinion public on social media.
"Don't hit send," he said. "Should have been smarter about the whole situation, about the tweet. Whether you feel that way or not, don't tweet it."
Coach Hue Jackson, who plans to jump into Lake Erie on Friday to make good on a promise he made when the team was going 0-16 last season, knew Randall would get some heat for his tweet.
"I think what Damarious found out is that there are a lot of passionate Cleveland fans here, and you've got to be careful about what you say," Jackson said. "I don't think he meant any harm. I think he has a love and a respect for Curry, obviously. But he found out that, 'Hey, look, in this city it's about the Cavaliers and LeBron James."
Jackson also used a comment made by James following Cleveland's win in Boston on Sunday as a teaching tool for the Browns.
"Just the other day, I was able to show them LeBron's message to the media in Game 7 when he talked about team," he said.
"I thought it was tremendous. I thought what he said about his other teammates and how they are a huge part of it and how people who have not played the game or wore shorts or been in a locker room understand what it takes to win. I thought that was sensational. I said that to our football team."

TAIPEI (Taiwan News)—A person in a small town in northern Taiwan saw a street person dredging up foods from a dirty kitchen leftovers bin on the street and his strong sympathy for the street person had prompted a wave of support from netizens and police. Now the street person surnamed Chan has been brought home by his family after they were alerted by the story on social media.
A man of Tongsiao Township, Miaoli County surnamed Yang said he saw a street person dredging up foods from a leftovers bin on the street to eat in cold weather on December 8. As he couldn’t bear to see somebody living in such a wretched condition as eating dirty leftovers, he went to buy a box of braised pork rice, miso soup and soybean drink and gave the foods to him for free, hoping him not to eat leftovers again.
Yang even went as far as to take it to Tongsiao townspeople’s Facebook fan club to urge townspeople to give the street person a helping hand if they see him on the street. Yang’s post has gone so viral that thousands of people clicked the Like button and that some people brought over noodles, bread and drinks they bought and gave the foods to Chan in relay fashion so he could have three meals a day.
Bakery owner Wu Chieh-hung (吳杰紘) said that he saw the post on the internet and learned that Chan seemed to be physically handicapped and was also not good at expressing himself, so he sent Chan bread and cakes the store made so he could have something to eat at any time.
Tongsiao police chief Chou Kuo-ping (周國平) said on Monday that besides the crowdsourcing, police officers were worried about him living on the street, so they went to look for him and brought him back to the police station. It happened that Chan’s family were alerted by the messages on Facebook, so they came from Changhua and brought him back home, Chou added.
Chan’s family told police that Chan was unsociable and ran away very often, which made the family members very concerned about him. However, Chan’s family expressed their hearty thanks to Tongsiao’s police and people for their great help.
The local police chief praised the help of the internet as well as the warm local community, saying that in less than 36 hours, Chan not only got great help from sympathetic townspeople but also went home safely.

Matt Adcock reviews Justice League (12A), starring Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot
Buckle up for another super smack-down as the heavyweight characters of the DC Comics Extended Universe – Batman (Ben Affleck), Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), The Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher) assemble to form the ‘Justice League’.
With earth deemed to be unprotected after Superman (Henry Cavill) “died” in Batman vs Superman, world killer CGI alien Steppenwolf (Ciarán Hinds) and his army of flying insect men decide to come and forcibly take over. Obviously all that’s required to turn our planet into a murky computer generated hell are three ‘mother boxes’ which are hidden and protected by the Amazonians, Atlantians and erm, Humans.
Cue two hours of fast forward team building and bonding, pondering about and then trying to resurrect Superman himself in order to give us a fighting chance and some actually decent and fun banter between the various heroes.
Director Zack Snyder crams in a lot after his BvS was accused of being overly leisurely paced – but this time just as we’re getting into an exciting action situation or an interesting conversation, things cut and rush on to something else (often some plot exposition to help viewers keep up).
Justice League is very much the DC version of Avengers – and if that sounds like your super powered cup of tea then you’ll have a blast watching this band of iconic heroes doing their thing. Wonder Woman keeps up her scene stealing form after her great solo film earlier this year but all the team have some good moments.
If you’ve had enough comic book superhero action then this won’t likely change your mind. But for long term fans (full disclosure I LOVE both Superman and Batman, ok and Wonder Woman) then there is plenty to make you grin with glee.
As a film it is a bit of a mess – and weak points include a seriously forgettable villain who looks like he’s escaped from an Xbox rather than outer space and the jump cuts that hamper coherent plot development.
Somewhere in this jumble is an epic adventure that rivals anything Marvel have put on screen – as it stands though, Justice League is a great fun movie but not one that will have the Avengers losing sleep as they plan their Infinity War next year.
Be sure to check the after credit scenes too for both clues of what might come next and a super stand off that made some of the audience I saw this with cheer!
BRUSSELS (AP) — Movie star Angelina Jolie says she and NATO's chief have agreed on ways to help the military alliance better combat the use of sexual violence against women and children in conflict zones.
Jolie said Wednesday that wherever sexual violence occurs "peace is far harder and far more costly to achieve. It therefore has a direct bearing on NATO's efforts to protect stability."
Speaking after a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in Brussels, she said: "We are going to focus on training, reporting, monitoring and awareness as a way of ending impunity."
Jolie, a special envoy for the U.N. refugee agency, warned that rape is being "used as a weapon to achieve political or military goals."
HELSINKI (AP) — A Swedish think tank says South Korea's arms sales hit record levels last year, pushed by the continuous military threat from North Korea, complicated relations with China and a government decision to increase domestic arms production.
The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, or SIPRI, said Monday that arms sales by South Korean companies in 2016 stood at $8.4 billion, up 21 percent from the previous year.
SIPRI researcher Aude Fleurant said Seoul has been developing its own arms production since the 1970s to reduce dependency on foreign suppliers because of "threat perception in the region," and the results are now being seen.
The report said said the world's 100 biggest armaments groups sold weapons and weapons systems worth $375 billion in 2016, up 2 percent from 2015.

NEW YORK (AP) — The New York City health department says one person has died and two others have become severely ill after they contracted a rare disease transmitted by rats.
The three cases occurred in the last two months in a Bronx neighborhood. City officials say it's the first time a cluster of cases has been identified.
The disease is called leptospirosis (lehp-toh-spuhr-ROH'-sihs).
Infections commonly occur through exposure to rat urine. The disease is rarely spread from person to person. It can be treated with antibiotics.
The city says it's reducing the rat population in the area and educating residents about the disease.
The New York Times (http://nyti.ms/2lOMiA9 ) says that from 2006 to 2016, 26 cases were reported in the city; the Bronx had the highest number with eight.

Electra Consumer Products is expected to buy Golan Telecom for 350 million NIS. Electra will pay Golan's owners 90 million NIS outright, and Cellcom will loan 130 million NIS to Electra to aid them in making the purchase. In addition, Electra will take another 130 million NIS as a bank loan.
Former Pelephone CEO Gil Sharon will serve as CEO of Golan Telecom.
Golan owes Cellcom 600 million NIS, and debates regarding who will buy Golan and what will happen to Golan customers have continued for several months.
The current agreement stipulates Electra will pay Cellcom 200-250 million NIS in user fees for the next decade. This amount will include and help cover Golan's current debt.
Golan has had financial difficulties for over a year, and creditor cellphone company Cellcom was reported several times as planning to buy the newer company. However, the government is interested in diversifying the market, and was therefore hesitant to allow the merge. In fact, the sale was about to go through when Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu canceled it.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) - The Chief Minister of India's state of Maharashtra, Devendra Fadnavis, said on his official twitter account Tuesday that a meeting and discussions with Hon Hai executives were held the same day to prepare for setting up manufacturing facilities in the state.
Hon Hai Precision Industry Ltd., better known as Foxconn outside Taiwan, the world's largest electronics contract manufacturer and Apple's major iPhone supplier, signed an agreement to invest US$5 billion in the state in 2015 over a course of five years. Touted as the largest FDI project in the country, the agreement is to build up a plant that produces electronic products.
“Foxconn reiterated their plans to set up production facility here and investment committed in MoU, said Maharashtra is the most favoured destination,” Fadnavis tweeted after meeting a delegation of Foxconn officials led by Simon CP Hsing, the spokesperson for the company.
The company is said to be currently looking for new locations in Pune and Konkan for plants to manufacture electronic components for mobile phones, as part of the company’s plan to make India a key global manufacturing hub serving Africa and West Asia, and a big partner in e-commerce and renewable energy.
Maharashtra, on India's west coast, includes the city of Mumbai.

In early 2018, I received an email from a TechRepublic member asking me to revise and update an article I wrote back in 2012. In Add Google Docs to the Windows 7 New menu (revised), I showed how to add various links to Google Docs to the New section of the Windows 7 context menu. It was a complicated hack of the Windows Registry and not something anyone should undertake lightly.
Since receiving that email, we have been exploring other options users can take to add easy access to Google Docs to Microsoft Windows 10. The simplest and most efficient way is to add links to the Chrome jump list located on the Taskbar as explained in How to create new Google Docs using jump lists in the Microsoft Windows 10 taskbar.
SEE: Comparison chart: Enterprise collaboration tools (Tech Pro Research)
However, despite showing you an easier way, and despite the warnings, some of you will still want to use the method that involves hacking the Windows 10 Registry file. Here are the steps you can take to add links to the Windows context menu (Figure A) that will allow you to start a new Google Doc, Spreadsheet, Presentation, or Drawing.
Figure A
WARNING! This technique involves the edit of the Windows 10 Registry file. The Registry is vital to the operation of the Windows operating system. A corrupted Registry could render Windows inoperable and require a complete re-installation to repair. Backup the Registry and create a System Restore point before you attempt this technique.
SEE: Windows 10 power tips: Secret shortcuts to your favorite settings (Tech Pro Research)
Editing the Registry
The total amount of editing to be done to the Windows Registry with this technique is too great and too rife with the possibility of error to list in this article. Instead, to simplify the process, I have created a downloadable file that you can use to do the edit for you. Click the link below to download the file and then extract its contents into an empty folder.
AddGoogleDocsToNewMenu.zip
The file was originally created by HowToGeek for Windows 7 but has been modified to reflect changes made by Google over the years. That is the other major drawback of this technique, besides editing the Windows Registry, Google could change the links to create new documents at any time, which would break this hack and require another revision.
Figure B
The folder with the extracted files should look like Figure B. Copy the four icon files to the Windows folder so the system can find them. Next, run the AddGoogleDocsToNewMenu.reg file by double-clicking it. The system will warn you about editing the Registry file, click OK and let the edit take place.
It may take a few seconds for the change to finish processing, but the next time you right-click on an empty spot on the Windows Desktop and navigate to the New menu item you should see four new entries, as shown in Figure C.
Figure C
Domain
This edit is specific to the free version of the Google productivity suite. Subscribers often use Google Docs from within a domain structure. In this situation, the AddGoogleDocsToNewMenu.reg file must be changed to reflect the domain. Links to each type of document will have to be modified to look like this:
https://docs.google.com/a/YOURDOMAIN/document/crea...
Right-click on the AddGoogleDocsToNewMenu.reg file and open it with Notepad or some other text editor. Do not just double-click it or select Open—that will just run the file with the wrong links. Change the links of each section to reflect your domain and then save the file.
Revert to normal
If you want to remove the links from the New item list of the Windows context menu, double-click and run the other file located in the download called: UninstallGoogleNewMenu.reg. This file will eliminate the keys created by the other file and revert the New menu back to its default settings.
SEE: How to create new Google Docs using jump lists in the Microsoft Windows 10 taskbar (TechRepublic)
Be careful
This technique should work for any version of Windows 10 and as long as Google maintains the current file reference system. However, it is the more dangerous option. Adding links to the Taskbar makes more sense, particularly in an enterprise environment, where IT departments frown severely on users editing the Windows Registry.

News of CBA CEO’s departure comes as bank faces court action launched by AUSTRAC
Commonwealth Bank of Australia CEO Ian Narev will leave CBA by the end of FY18.
The chair of the bank’s board, Catherine Livingstone, this morning announced details of the CEO’s departure. The exact timing will depend on the “outcome of an ongoing comprehensive internal and external search process,” Livingstone said in a statement.
“Succession planning is an ongoing process at all levels of the Bank. In discussions with Ian we have also agreed it is important for the business that we deal with the speculation and questions about his tenure. Today’s statement provides that clarity and will ensure he can continue to focus, as CEO, on successfully managing the business.”
Narev’s impending departure comes as the bank faces accusations of failing to meet its obligations under Australia’s anti-money-laundering rules.
AUSTRAC, which enforces the anti-money-laundering regime, has launched Federal Court action against the bank.
The bank has blamed a “coding error” for a failure to generate mandatory reports relating to large cash deposits made using its Intelligent Deposit Machines (IDMs).
AUSTRAC has said that CBA failed to report 53,506 “threshold transactions” — transactions involving $10,000 or more — between 5 November 2012 and 1 September 2015.
“Suspected money laundering was conducted through CommBank accounts, by way of cash deposits, many through IDMs, followed immediately by international and domestic transfers,” an AUSTRAC court filing states.
CBA has been accused of failing to report suspicious matters either on time or at all involving transactions totalling over $77 million.
The bank has said that when the IDMs were first rolled out, the correct threshold transaction reports (TTRs) were generated. However after a software update “a coding error occurred which meant the IDMs did not create the TTRs needed.”
Earlier this month CBA reported statutory net profit after tax of $9.93 billion for the full year, up 7.6 per cent, and cash net NPAT of $9.88 billion, up 4.6 per cent. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia’s IT services expenses hit $1.94 billion in the 12 months ending 30 June, the bank reported.
BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — A Romanian auction house is selling memorabilia belonging to former Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu to mark what would have been his 100th birthday.
The "Golden Era" online auction kicks off Wednesday evening. Among the 250 items going under the hammer are a fur-lined hunting cap worn by Ceausescu, an avid hunter, and shoes and a purse made for his wife, Elena Ceausescu. There's even toilet paper, which was scarce in the late days of communism.
Iulian Plestiu, research director at Artmark auction house, says potential buyers are middle-aged Romanians collecting memorabilia or younger people looking to acquire one of the now-trendy period posters.
Communism in Romania ended in 1989 when the Ceausescus were executed after a summary trial.
LOS ANGELES (AP) — In another newsroom shake-up at the Los Angeles Times, veteran Chicago journalist Jim Kirk was named editor in chief Monday to replace Lewis D'Vorkin, whose short tenure was marked by clashes with staff.
Kirk, 52, became the third top editor at the Times in less than six months. He had briefly served in the job on an interim basis during a management overhaul from August until November, when D'Vorkin joined the paper.
Kirk previously worked at the Chicago Tribune, Bloomberg News and Adweek.
He became publisher and editor of the Chicago Sun-Times after it was purchased in 2012 by Michael Ferro, who is now chairman of Tronc, Inc., the Los Angeles Times' parent company.
Kirk took the job at the Los Angeles Times just two weeks after being named interim editor of the New York Daily News. That job has now gone to Jim Rich, who will return to the paper after a stint with the Huffington Post.
Reporters at the Times have become alarmed by recent hiring of several news executives who reported to business executives — not to editors in the newsroom.
Those hires sparked fears that the business side would wield undue influence in editorial matters. Traditionally, the editorial and business sides of a paper work separately to maintain journalistic credibility.
Earlier this month, journalists at the Times voted to unionize for the first time in the paper's 136-year history.
D'Vorkin, 65, will move into a new job as chief content officer for Tronc, developing content for digital and mobile consumers, according to company spokeswoman Marisa Kollias. He was chief product officer at Forbes until October.
"We are continuing to invest in high-quality journalism, which will always be the company's top priority," Justin Dearborn, Tronc's chief executive, said in a statement,
Kirk will report to Tronc President Tim Knight.
The Times has seen years of staff cutbacks and management changes. D'Vorkin's nearly three-month tenure as editor was marked by two combative newsroom-wide staff meetings.
Reporters and editors expressed concern that Tronc was building a shadow newsroom to blur the lines between news and advertising and boost revenue. Editors and reporters asked questions about the business-side operation, but D'Vorkin and other Tronc executives declined to discuss their plans.
"The Los Angeles Times Guild would like to congratulate Jim Kirk on being named the next editor in chief of the Los Angeles Times," the steering committee said in a statement. "We also look forward to working together in the future as one team — and we look forward to hearing his plans for the paper."
Just 10 days ago, Times' publisher Ross Levinsohn was placed on unpaid leave following revelations that he had been a defendant in two sexual harassment lawsuits while he worked at other media companies.
Tronc has hired a law firm to investigate the allegations against Levinsohn made in a detailed report by National Public Radio. The probe is ongoing.

NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) – The New York Police Department will hold a late-night candlelight vigil Wednesday to honor Detective Miosotis Familia, the NYPD officer killed after being ambushed in a mobile command unit in the Bronx.
Familia, a mother of three, was assassinated on July 5, 2017, by a gunman who was later killed by police. She was sitting in an NYPD Truck when it happened.
Police say she was killed for her uniform. She had served for 12 years in the 46th Precinct.
The vigil beings at 11:30 p.m. at the corner of Ryer Avenue and E. 181st Street in the Bronx.
At the time of the shooting, NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill called Familia’s slaying “a direct attack on police officers assigned to safeguard the people of New York City.
“Make no mistake: Officer Familia was murdered for her uniform and for the responsibility she embraced,” O’Neill said in a statement. “And for the NYPD, regularly achieving lower crime figures means absolutely nothing when one of our own is brutally shot and killed.”
Her daughter, 20-year-old Genesis Villella, put her college education on hold to fill her mother’s shoes, raising her 12-year-old twin siblings, Delilah and Peter.
Thanks to donations last year, Familia’s family was given a mortgage-free three-bedroom apartment in the Skyview Towers overlooking the Hudson River in Riverdale.
During a National Peace Officers’ Memorial Service in Washington DC last May, President Donald Trump recognized Familia’s family in attendance.
“I just want to say that, to your entire family, it’s such an honor to have you up here,” said Trump. “She loved the department. She loved being a police officer. She loved her job. She was respected by everybody.”
PARIS (AP) — The alliance of carmakers Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi says it's the world's top automaker after selling 10.6 million cars last year, thanks to growing demand for SUVs and electric vehicles.
The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance says collective sales rose 6.5 percent in 2017, the first year full year that Mitsubishi Motors was included in the group.
The group sold vehicles in nearly 200 countries under 10 brands, led by China, the U.S., France and Japan.
Nissan sales grew 4.6 percent to 5.8 million cars, while France-based Renault's grew 8.5 percent and Mitsubishi's 10 percent.
Alliance CEO Carlos Ghosn claimed the results make the group the world's No. 1 carmaker. Volkswagen reported sales of 10.74 million vehicles last year, but Ghosn has said that 200,000 of Volkswagen's vehicles were trucks that shouldn't count.
LONDON (AP) — This is not a metaphor: Britain's Parliament is a mess.
The 19th-century London building is crumbling, leaky, infested with vermin and riddled with asbestos. Fixing it will take years and cost billions, but experts say the alternative could be catastrophic.
After years of dithering, lawmakers are set to vote Wednesday on what to do — but there's a good chance they will opt for more delay.
Experts warn the Victorian Gothic building is at risk of a flood or fire that could leave it uninhabitable. A 2016 report urged politicians to move out for six years for renovations costing 3.5 billion pounds ($5 billion).
On Wednesday lawmakers will vote on several options, from agreeing to leave the building so work can begin to deferring a decision for several more years.
ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- The Washington Redskins have restructured the contract of their longest-tenured player, DeAngelo Hall.
Hall said Wednesday he agreed to a pay cut in the hopes of remaining on the roster after missing most of last season with a torn ACL in his right knee. Hall, who has been in Washington since 2008, was set to count more than $5 million against the salary cap.
The 33-year-old converted from cornerback to safety midway through the 2015 season and is still recovering from surgery last fall. Asked about restructuring to stick around, Hall said, ''We worked something out'' this week.
Achilles tendon, toe and knee injuries have limited Hall to 17 games the past three seasons. Coach Jay Gruden called Hall a mainstay who ''keeps the boat from sinking from time to time.''

KING — The West Stokes women’s soccer team remains perfect in league action after outlasting Surry Central 3-0 on Monday night, and did so while handing the Golden Eagles their second conference loss of the season.
The match did not see its first goal until nearly 30 minutes into the first half when Zoe Wehr’s header connected with the back of the net. Approximately four minutes later, Micha Harris was credited with the assist when she crossed to Anna Bates for another Wildcat goal. This one wrapped up the first-half scoring, with West Stokes holding a 2-0 lead when the half concluded.
Neither team scored in the first 10 minutes of the second half, but in the 51st minute, the lead stretched to 3-0 when the Wildcats’ Lovisa Fahraeus connected with Wehr. Wehr duly became the owner of two of the three Wildcat goals.
Similarly to the first, the Wildcats continued to hold Surry Central scoreless in the second half and finished with another Western Piedmont Athletic Conference win. West Stokes now leads the WPAC by a full game over Forbush, with Central in third place, two games behind.
West Stokes, the fifth-ranked 2A team in the state according to MaxPreps.com, improved its season record to 14-2-1, 4-0 with the win. The Wildcats are on a 14-match unbeaten streak since beginning the year 1-2. They will host North Surry on Wednesday night.
Surry Central, now 10-6 overall, 2-2 in the WPAC, has the rest of the week off before suiting up to host South Stokes for another conference matchup next Monday at 5:30.

First quarter 2018 net sales and financial services revenues were $5.65 billion, 33 percent higher than the $4.24 billion earned in the first quarter of 2017. PACCAR achieved net income of $512.1 million ($1.45 per diluted share) in the first quarter of this year, 65 percent higher than the $310.3 million ($.88 per diluted share) earned in the same period last year.
Ron Armstrong added, “PACCAR’s excellent balance sheet and strong operating cash flow have enabled the company to invest $3.0 billion in new facilities, products and services during the past five years. New Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF vehicles, the integrated PACCAR powertrain, enhanced truck and engine production facilities, new PACCAR Parts distribution centers (PDCs) and TRP Stores are contributing to PACCAR’s long-term growth.”
Highlights – First Quarter 2018
Highlights of PACCAR’s financial results during the first quarter of 2018 include:
Record consolidated net sales and revenues of $5.65 billion. Net income of $512.1 million. Record PACCAR Parts revenues of $939.9 million and pretax profits of $191.8 million. Cash generated from operations of $528.5 million. Research and development expenses of $76.0 million. Manufacturing cash and marketable securities of $3.47 billion. Excellent stockholders’ equity of $8.57 billion.
“PACCAR achieved outstanding financial performance in the first quarter of 2018. Surging truck and aftermarket parts demand, and excellent operational leverage from increased production, delivered Truck, Parts and Other gross margins of 14.8 percent,” noted Harrie Schippers, PACCAR president and chief financial officer. “Quarterly net profits also increased due to the new U.S. tax law. PACCAR has averaged $2.4 billion annually in operating cash flow in the last five years. PACCAR’s recent investments in truck and engine production facilities have provided the capacity for PACCAR to continue to grow its market share. PACCAR’s supplier partners have performed well as industry production has increased.”
Global Truck Markets
“First quarter 2018 U.S. and Canada Class 8 truck industry orders were more than double the same period last year,” said Gary Moore, PACCAR executive vice president. “The truck market reflects the strong economy and excellent freight demand. We’ve increased our estimate of 2018 Class 8 truck industry retail sales for the U.S. and Canada to a range of 265,000-285,000 vehicles.”
DAF’s above 16-tonne truck orders increased 41 percent in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period last year. “DAF’s new $110 million state-of-the-art paint facility in Westerlo, Belgium has expanded DAF’s production capacity, enabling DAF to increase market share in this year’s stronger truck market,” said Preston Feight, DAF president and PACCAR vice president. “DAF achieved an excellent 16.4 percent market share in the European above 16-tonne segment in the first quarter of 2018.” European truck industry registrations in the above 16-tonne segment are estimated to be in a range of 300,000-320,000 vehicles in 2018.
PACCAR has recently increased its investment in South America by expanding its DAF truck range in Brasil and the Andean region, and opening a new PDC in Panama City, Panama. The Brasil above 16-tonne truck market is projected to increase to 40,000-45,000 vehicles in 2018, compared to 32,000 last year. “The expanding truck market and DAF Brasil’s higher market share have driven increased production,” said Michael Kuester, DAF Brasil president.

PACCAR Parts’ sophisticated logistics systems are driving industry-leading efficiency at DAF, Kenworth and Peterbilt dealers, and TRP Stores. PACCAR Parts shipped a record 16 million global order lines from its PDCs in 2017. “PACCAR Parts’ integrated supply chain enables customers to increase their productivity and profitability,” said Laura Bloch, PACCAR Parts assistant general manager of operations.
Industry Recognition
The PACCAR truck factory in Ste-Thérèse, Canada earned a prestigious 2018 Manufacturing Leadership Award from Frost & Sullivan’s Manufacturing Leadership Council in recognition of its production technology advancements. PACCAR Ste-Thérèse was honored for its innovative use of automated guided vehicle technology to increase assembly capacity, efficiency and safety. “The employees at the PACCAR Ste-Thérèse plant are dedicated to building the industry’s highest quality medium-duty trucks. Kenworth and Peterbilt customers benefit from our factory innovations and purchased a record number of medium-duty trucks in 2017,” said Chakib Toubal-Seghir, PACCAR Ste-Thérèse plant manager.
Capital Investments and Research and Development
PACCAR’s excellent long-term profits, strong balance sheet, and intense focus on quality, technology and productivity have enabled the company to invest $6.1 billion in world-class facilities, innovative products and new technologies during the past decade. “In 2018, capital expenditures of $425-$475 million and research and development expenses of $300-$320 million are targeted for new truck models, integrated powertrains including electric, hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell technologies, enhanced aerodynamic truck designs, advanced driver assistance systems and truck connectivity, and expanded manufacturing and parts distribution facilities,” commented George West, PACCAR vice president.
PACCAR has recently invested $70 million in state-of-the-art machining equipment in its Columbus, Mississippi and Eindhoven, Netherlands engine factories. “This equipment increases engine production capacity and supports the growth of Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF,” said Kyle Quinn, PACCAR Chief Technology Officer.
Financial Services Companies Achieve Good Results
PACCAR Financial Services (PFS) has a portfolio of 187,000 trucks and trailers, with total assets of $13.59 billion. PACCAR Leasing, a major full-service truck leasing company in North America and Europe with a fleet of 37,000 vehicles, is included in this segment. PFS’ first quarter 2018 pretax income was $67.5 million, 19 percent higher than the $56.8 million earned in the first quarter of 2017. PFS achieved first quarter 2018 revenues of $332.2 million compared to $302.2 million in 2017. “PFS’ portfolio performed well during the first quarter of 2018.” said Bob Bengston, PACCAR senior vice president. “First quarter industry demand for used trucks was strong, with higher prices. Kenworth and Peterbilt truck resale values continue to command a 10-20 percent premium over competitors’ trucks.” PACCAR’s strong balance sheet, complemented by its A+/A1 credit ratings, enables PFS to offer competitive retail financing to Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF dealers and customers in 24 countries on four continents.
PACCAR Financial Corp. (PFC) recently opened a new truck remarketing center in Fontana, California, near Los Angeles.

CLEVELAND (AP) — The Latest on the fatal house fire in Cleveland that killed two children and two adults (all times local):
9 p.m.
Authorities have located the bodies of all four victims of a house fire in Cleveland.
Fire officials and family members say a 3-year-old boy, an 8-year-old girl, the boy's 46-year-old father and the man's 44-year-old nephew were in the house when the blaze broke out overnight Tuesday and were unable to escape.
Crews needed heavy equipment to take apart and stabilize the heavily damaged home before it was safe to go inside and search for the victims.
By late Tuesday night, officials had announced that all four victims had been found.
The cause of the fire remains under investigation.
___
5:05 p.m.
Fire investigators have recovered the bodies of three people who died in a Cleveland house fire and are continuing to search for a fourth victim.
The city's fire chief says the search has been hampered by heavy damage to the home that first made it unsafe for firefighters to look for the victims.
Investigators and family members say a 3-year-old boy, an 8-year-old girl, the boy's 46-year-old father and the man's 44-year-old nephew were in the house when the fire started overnight Tuesday.
Firefighters say the mother of one of the children escaped by jumping from a second-floor window.
A fire department spokesman tells Cleveland.com that the woman said she and her husband tried but couldn't get to the children.
A cause of the fire hasn't been released.
___
1:30 p.m.
Fire investigators say a heavily damaged home where two children and two adults are missing after an overnight fire in Cleveland is too dangerous to search.
A fire department spokesman says construction equipment will be used to take apart the home and make it safe for firefighters to search inside.
He says search crews will be careful not to disturb any potential evidence that could help determine what caused the fire.
Firefighters say a woman believed to be the children's mother escaped by jumping from a second floor window early Tuesday morning.

ABINGDON, VA (WJHL) – At prosecutors’ request, the Virginia Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission is now required to turn over all documents sent from Judge Kurt Pomrenke or his attorney in connection to his ongoing administrative case there, according to federal court documents.
United States Magistrate Judge Pamela Meade Sargent filed the order today ahead of Judge Pomrenke’s federal criminal trial next month for alleged contempt. Prosecutors believe the husband of former Bristol Virginia Utilities executive Stacey Pomrenke violated a court order when he shared court records with JIRC last year.
The commission opened a case against Judge Pomrenke last month, alleging misconduct. The Virginia Supreme Court will likely consider whether the judge should retire, be censured or be removed in the months after his criminal trial, which is scheduled for September 13.
In a statement, Judge Pomrenke previously said he looks forward “to the opportunity to address these matters before the court.”

As sports fans, we sometimes take things for granted. It’s not entirely our fault. In this day and age, it just seems as if we’ve just seen everything. So when something truly special happens, it doesn’t always attract the appreciation it deserves.
Such is the case for the amazing rivalry that has developed between the Golden State Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers over the last few seasons.
We have seen some mighty clashes over the years. There’s no denying that the competition during the 1980s between Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers and Larry Bird and the Boston Celtics was fierce.
From 1980-1989, at least one of these two teams was represented in each NBA Finals. The Lakers took home five titles, while the Celtics managed to win three. Los Angeles and Boston owned the decade, but at the end of the era, these two legendary franchises only met in the championship three times in four years.
A look at rivalries in other sports reveals similar storylines.
The Dallas Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers lead the way for the NFL, having met three times in the Super Bowl. However these three match-ups occurred in 1976, 1979, and 1996. You’d have to go all the way back to the early 1950s, before the NFL-AFL merger, to find the same two teams vying for a championship in three consecutive years (the Detroit Lions and Cleveland Browns, 1952-1954).
>>MORE: NBA Coverage
In the NHL, you also have to turn back the clock to the early 50s, when goalies did not wear face masks, to find the sport’s latest and only trilogy. The Detroit Red Wings and Montreal Canadiens met in the Stanley Cup Finals from 1954-1956. No two teams have done this since.
It’s been almost a century in MLB. The New York Giants and the New York Yankees are the only teams to meet in three straight World Series, and it happened from 1921-1923.
Intense rivalries, at the highest level, do not happen often. This is why what the Cavaliers and Warriors have accomplished over the last few years is a truly spectacular.
For the first time in American sports history, two teams will go toe-to-toe in the championship for the fourth consecutive year.
But it didn’t always look as if the Warriors and Cavs’ round-four matchup would happen.
Golden State dealt with injuries to all four of the team’s all-stars this season. Kevin Durant and Steph Curry sat out the most of the four, combining to miss 45 games during the regular season. Curry was also absent in the postseason until Game 2 of the Conference Semifinals.
Golden State then had to get past a Houston Rockets squad that led the league in wins and was structured to match up against this Warriors squad, which obviously was no easy task. They lost former Finals MVP Andre Iguodala in Game 3, and found themselves down 3-2 — backs to the wall — heading into Game 6.
But the Warriors battled and found a way to persevere, winning Games 6 and 7 to clinch their spot in the Finals.
Things looked even more uncertain in Cleveland this season. After Kyrie Irving forced his way out of town last summer, LeBron James was left with a rather weak supporting cast.
Upon struggling throughout the first half of the season, the Cavaliers shook things up at the trade deadline. Cleveland sent six players packing to various cities while infusing the team with some youth by acquiring Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr., George Hill and Rodney Hood.
The Cavs finished the season as the Eastern Conference’s No. 4 seed, and needed seven games to get past the Indiana Pacers in the first round of the playoffs. Things also looked gloomy during the Eastern Conference Finals, as James and Co. went down 3-2 against the Celtics.
But as we’ve seen many times before, James put Cleveland on his back and guided the team to back-to-back victories, even playing all 48 minutes in Game 7.
LeBron has now scored 612 points in the 2018 playoffs, the most ever in a single postseason heading into the Finals. He needs only 148 points to break Michael Jordan’s record of 759 points in the 1992 postseason, and considering that he is averaging 34.0 points per game through the first three rounds, this seems like a realistic accomplishment.
So NBA fans, one year later, we are right back where we left off — Golden State vs. Cleveland, Round 4. And everyone should be thrilled with this Finals matchup.
We must applaud what these two franchises have done over the last four seasons. We should enjoy watching five of the last six NBA MVPs who will play in this matchup.
And, most importantly, we should appreciate the moment, as we are watching something that has never been done before, and may never happen again.
We are witnessing American sports history.

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina finally got its offense - and maybe its confidence - going again.
Luke Maye scored 26 points to help the 19th-ranked Tar Heels beat Pittsburgh 96-65 on Saturday night, ending their first three-game losing streak in four years.
''Our guys around here, you lose a couple and the kids start feeling the pressure because they're such good kids,'' UNC coach Roy Williams said.
The response was a positive, if for no other reason than the Tar Heels (17-7, 6-5 Atlantic Coast Conference) had a relatively stress-free night while matching their best scoring output in league play.
The Tar Heels also shot 51 percent, made 11 3-pointers and dominated the boards (47-28) en route to 22 second-chance points. Maye led six players in double figures, including junior Kenny Williams, who had his best scoring night after several rough games. And Theo Pinson (13 rebounds, eight assists) played a strong floor game.
In short, they made things look routine against a team that's yet to win an ACC game.
''We needed tonight,'' Pinson said.
UNC found itself in a close game late in the first half before blowing it open with a big run spanning halftime. Graduate transfer Cameron Johnson scored eight points against his former team in UNC's 14-3 half-ending flurry, which grew to 25-5 when Joel Berry II hit his fourth 3-pointer for a 56-37 lead with 16:48 left.
Freshman Marcus Carr scored 22 points for the Panthers (8-16, 0-11), who hit eight first-half 3s to hang around but made 2 of 16 after halftime as the Tar Heels' lead ballooned.
That sent Pitt to its 11th straight loss, the longest skid in program history.
''They played well obviously,'' Panthers coach Kevin Stallings said. ''I didn't think that we did so much, but certainly you have to give them credit. It probably wasn't the most ideal time to catch them.''
There were no injuries in the incident.
About 40-50 people were in The Glade Church at the time of the incident, Moore said. The weapon apparently discharged while the gun owner, who had a carry permit, stood at a guest service desk.
The gun was in the gun owner’s left pocket, and it is not clear if something else was in the pocket and caused the gun to fire, Moore said.
The bullet went through the floor and caused damage to the carpet. It did not hit anyone, including the gun owner.
“It was on Easter Sunday, so of course it’s going to be a crowded church,” Moore said. “This is one of those situations where, as a gun owner, with great power comes great responsibility. A permit-holder is legally and ethically responsible for every single bullet fired out of a weapon. Fortunately, no one was hurt.”
The investigation is considered ongoing, and the gun owner was not immediately identified.
“Investigators will consult with the district attorney on any possible charges that may stem from this incident,” Moore said.

SEATTLE (AP) -- Marco Gonzales is answering all those preseason questions about his place in Seattle's rotation.
Hard to argue with his results of late.
Gonzales pitched into the seventh inning and did not allow an earned run for a third consecutive start, helping the Mariners top the Texas Rangers 2-1 on Monday.
Seattle won for the ninth time in 10 games and reached 13 games above .500 for the first time since late in the 2014 season. And it was once again a one-run win. The Mariners have been held to three runs or less in seven of the past eight games, but are 7-1 in those games thanks largely to their pitching.
Gonzales was just the latest performance, running his streak of consecutive innings without allowing an earned run to 19 1/3.
''Yes, there was a lot of questions from a lot of people. I'm really happy for him,'' manager Scott Servais said. ''I think that's what our scouts saw when we made the trade for him. The guys in the front office recognized if we get this guy, get him back completely healthy and in a really good environment he could be a guy that could carry innings.''
Gonzales (5-3) lasted 6 2/3 innings and has not allowed an earned run since May 12 when he gave up four runs in a loss to Detroit. His only issue against Texas was walks. Gonzales walked four, including Ryan Rua with two outs in the seventh inning to conclude his day.
''I'm not trying to pay too much attention to that,'' Gonzales said of his recent performances. ''I'm trying to keep my approach simple, throw a lot of strikes, get ahead of guys and good things will happen when you do that.''
James Pazos got the final out of the seventh, before letting the duo of Alex Colome and Edwin Diaz work together for the first time. Colome, an All-Star closer acquired from Tampa Bay late last week, struck out a pair sandwiched around a two-out hit to finish the eighth inning, and Diaz pitched the ninth for his 19th save.
Story Continues
Seattle has 16 one-run wins, best in the majors.
''Winning is just fun. I won't lie, it would be nice if we go out tomorrow and win by like 10. That would be awesome,'' Seattle's Kyle Seager said.
The only run for Texas came in the third inning when Rougned Odor reached on a bunt single and eventually scored on a passed ball.
Texas starter Doug Fister (1-5) cruised through the first five innings, the only hit allowed a single by Andrew Romine in the third. It was a defensive miscue that created the opportunity for Seattle to take the lead.
With one out in the sixth, Denard Span hit a grounder to second base that should have ended the inning. Odor briefly bobbled the grounder and the Rangers were unable to turn the double play. Mitch Haniger's base hit barely eluded the diving attempt of shortstop Jurickson Profar, and Nelson Cruz and Seager followed with line-drive RBI singles.
Odor also got picked off second base in the fifth inning.
''We can pick apart the one if you want to, however I look at it as a whole and the positives form (Odor) outweigh the negatives today,'' Texas manager Jeff Banister said.
SPAN ARRIVES
Span, who also came over in the trade with the Rays, made his debut after being added to the 25-man roster. The Mariners optioned outfielder John Andreoli to Triple-A Tacoma to clear the roster spot. Span was 0 for 4.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Rangers: SS Elvis Andrus and 3B Adrian Beltre (hamstring) took ground balls before the game. It was the first time Andrus had done any field work since suffering a right elbow fracture in early April.
Mariners: SS Jean Segura was originally in the lineup, but was scratched. Segura was inadvertently kicked in the head during Saturday night's game and missed Sunday's game. Servais said Segura should return on Tuesday. ... The Mariners expect Dee Gordon will be able to return to the lineup Thursday barring any setbacks in his recovery from a toe injury.
UP NEXT
Rangers: Austin Bibens-Dirkx (0-1) will make his second start since being called up from Triple-A Round Rock. Bibens-Dirkx allowed four earned runs and eight hits in his debut against Kansas City.
Mariners: Felix Hernandez (5-4) will try to have a better first inning than his last start when he gave up four runs in the first to Oakland. Hernandez has struggled early in games and has re-examined some of his routine in hopes of being better from the start.

WASHINGTON (AP) – Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders says James T. Hodgkinson, the man authorities identified as opening fire on the Republican congressional baseball practice, had apparently volunteered on his presidential campaign.
Sanders, of Vermont, says in a statement: “I am sickened by this despicable act.” He says that “violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms.”
He paid tribute to Capitol Police for their response to the shooting, and said his “hopes and prayers” are with House GOP Whip Steve Scalise and others who were wounded.
Sanders challenged Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination in the 2016 presidential election. He adds in his statement that “real change” can only come through nonviolent action.

LaMelo Ball sat out Prienu Vytautas’ 82-79 loss to Alytaus Dzukija on Monday—his third straight DNP in a Lithuanian (LKL) League game. But the latest absence for LaVar Ball’s youngest son came not on account of a bad back, but rather due to illness.
“He had high temperature yesterday and could not practice and play,” Vytautas head coach Virginijus Seskus said after the defeat, according to a translation.
BC Vytautas missed Melo’s playmaking ability on the offensive end. The club tallied just 16 assists on 29 made baskets, against 14 turnovers, and managed a paltry 29 points in the first half.
LaMelo’s sickness came on the heels of his vacation to Barcelona with his family, including LiAngelo Ball, the previous week.
As a result of its latest loss, Vytautas remains mired in last place in the LKL, at 5-21. The Big Baller Brand-sponsored squad will have until Sunday, when it faces ninth-place Kedainiai Nevezis (6-20) at Prienai Arena, to get Melo and the rest of its injured guard corps fit for competition.

The Memorial Tournament presented by Nationwide always has been one of the premiere events on the PGA TOUR since its inception in 1976. And its status only seems to grow with legendary host Jack Nicklaus watching over the proceedings.
“It’s truly amazing to think that a tournament hosted by golf’s greatest champion in the game and played on one of the greatest golf courses in the game keeps getting better, but the Memorial Tournament continually rises in stature,” said Jim Nantz, longtime CBS Sports golf anchor. “For someone who treasures the sport and the history of the game as much as I do, it’s truly one of the great weekends of my year.”
Newly minted world No. 1 Justin Thomas heads a field that includes eight of the top in the world rankings, while five-time Memorial Tournament winner Tiger Woods returns for the first time since 2015. Along with Thomas, all of the other two-time winners on the PGA TOUR this season are entered: Justin Rose (No. 3 in the world and the 2010 Memorial winner), Columbus resident Jason Day, Bubba Watson and Patton Kizzire.
Former PGA champion Jason Dufner returns to defend his title.
“We virtually have the who’s who of players and virtually everybody’s here, and I think we have probably done pretty well,” the Golden Bear said of the strong 120-player field competing for a purse of $8.9 million.
Nantz, who has worked every Memorial Tournament since 1986, his rookie year on the network, takes a look at the storylines this week in Dublin, Ohio.
>>WATCH: The Memorial Tournament Live Stream
The PGA TOUR calls the Memorial Tournament an enhanced event because of the larger purse and three-year exemption for the winner. I’d argue it’s enhanced because the golf course is superb and Jack Nicklaus is the host. Agree?
The tournament is special for a multitude of reasons. This golf tournament has taken on the personality of truly being one of the biggest events in the sport. All you have to do is look at the field list to be dazzled and get the juices flowing. You’ve got a golf course that is ranked among the best in the world, and it’s hosted by the greatest champion in the history of the sport, there’s a lot for the passionate golf fan to get fired up about.
This week is a very strong field, with eight of the top 10 in the world and in the FedExCup standings. The Memorial always draws a strong field, but this one seems particularly top heavy.
It’s a reflection of what’s going on in the game of golf right now. For those of us who live the sport year-round, we’re seeing wonderful things, [particularly] where the game is going and how it’s trending. And the Memorial is one of those events that brings it all together. You can really sense that the players have a tremendously high regard for Jack Nicklaus and the tournament that he puts on.
Muirfield Village Golf Club can be an extremely tough test. We saw five-time winner Tiger Woods shoot 85 in the third round in 2015. But it also can yield some good scores. We’ve seen both extremes.
There are certainly a lot of places where your game can be exposed in a hurry if you’re off by a fraction. It doesn’t take much, as evidenced by last year’s winner, Jason Dufner, shooting 77 on Saturday and rebounding and still winning. He was just a fraction off in the third round, and it cost him a pair of hockey sticks. I love risk-reward in golf; it brings the sport to a whole new level of drama. You take the best tournaments and the most memorable events we watch, and the term risk-reward is usually a part of it. Just look at major championship golf — and this really is major championship level. Look at what makes the Masters so great. It’s the risk-reward nature of Augusta National Golf Club. You need highs mixed with the lows. You need the guy who pulls off the impossible shot and the guy who pays the penalty for coming up short. A young Jack Nicklaus knew what he was doing when he built Muirfield Village Golf Club all those years ago. It’s the perfect arena for golf at its best, golf at its most interesting.

Speaking of Woods, this is his first appearance here since that tough 2015 outing. What can we expect as he continues to put his game back together?
He’s got a tremendous track record at the Memorial Tournament. He’s come a long way in his attempt to rebound from back surgery. He’s been quite a story. But who knows what to expect? He’ll be closely watched, of that I am certain.
Justin Thomas makes his first start as the No. 1 player in the world. Does that make a difference to a player when he carries that banner? How will he respond?
When Adam Scott became No. 1 for the first time, he won at Colonial (in 2014), so who’s to say we won’t see that kind of response from Justin Thomas? This is a style of golf course that Justin Thomas grew up on. He was raised in these parts. His family has Ohio ties. This should be right in his wheelhouse. The fact that he is No. 1 doesn’t come as any great shock. It comes at a time in golf when there could be a revolving door at the top of the game.
Give us your favorites and dark horses?
There have been guys over the years who have won this golf tournament whom you [would] least expect to win. There have been guys who won for the first time there, like a Kenny Perry and a Tom Lehman. Then you have Jack, Tom Watson, Fred Couples [who] always played well there, and Tiger with his remarkable record. Muirfield Village is a great showcase for many Hall of Famers, so you think about Justin Thomas, Justin Rose, Rory McIlroy, or Jason Day, who has shown tremendous determination to get back to the top of the rankings. And there are many players who appear ready to add their name to the list of winners.

MIAMI (AP) -- Brian Beard Jr. hit two 3-pointers in the final three seconds to give Florida International a come-from-behind 71-68 win over Louisiana Tech in a wild finish to a Conference USA battle on Saturday night.
Beard tied the game at 68-68 on a 3-pointer with 2.7 seconds left. Jy'lan Washington turned the ball over on ensuing in-bounds play, giving FIU the ball near mid-court. Beard caught the in-bounds mass near the jump circle, dribbled twice and launched a desperation shot that connected at the buzzer for the win.
Beard, who scored 23 points to spur the Panthers 76-70 win over Southern Miss Thursday, finished with 19 points and dished 10 assists. Eric Lockett scored 15 points and Trejon Jacob added another 12 for FIU (11-13, 5-6).
Amorie Archibald got the Bulldogs even with a free throw with 1:04 left and Washington and Oliver Powell each hit two from the line to put LaTech up, 68-65 with :10 left.
Jacobi Boykins had 13 points and Archibald added another 12 to lead Louisiana Tech (14-10, 5-6).
NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — People from the iconic East Side neighborhood of Sutton Place have banded together to stop the construction of a giant glass tower.
As CBS2’s Emily Smith reported, the proposed project has become what some call a David vs. Goliath a race between the residents and the developer. The residents are now fighting to get their neighborhood rezoned.
Along the East River, the charming Sutton Place community is found and around on the street of the same name, from 52nd Street to 59th Street. But it has been anything put peaceful as some residents fight plans for the building that would dwarf its neighbors.
“It would be sitting here in this space like a monstrosity cantilevering out,” said Lisa Mercurio of Sutton Place.
“You put a tall building up on the street – on a street; a side street; a residential neighborhood like this, you’re going to lose light. You’re going to lose quality of life,” said Bonnie Behrend of Sutton Place.
“Sutton Place is historic if you walk up and down that beautiful avenue,” said Melissa Mittman of Sutton Place. Many residents point out that the Vanderbilt family once owned a home in Sutton Place.
The new plan calls for a 79-story residential tower. But the developer, Gamma, does not have a permit yet due to an incomplete application submission, according to the Department of Buildings.
Now it is a race, as Sutton Place residents try to get a rezoning plan approved first that would cap buildings at 24 stories. City Councilman Dan Garodnick (D-4th) said most every neighborhood in the city has a height limit for development – except Sutton Place.
He said it is due to outdated zoning restrictions – a quirk that dates back to the last time it was looked at in 1961.
“This is a glaring loophole in the zoning resolution which needs to be fixed. It should have been fixed a long time ago,” Garodnick said. “We have a proposal to do just that.”
Meanwhile, Garodnick has sent several letters to the Department of Buildings asking officials to not to approve any permits for a high-rise – at least until the residents’ rezoning plan gets some attention.
A representative of the developer, Gama, called the neighbors’ proposal “self-serving.”
“It will set a dangerous precedent that threatens to hamper the progress of not only our project, but also our city as a whole,” the statement said.
In response, some Sutton Place residents say they welcome anything that stymies big development and preserves the character of Sutton Place.
Rezoning Sutton Place would ultimately be up to Mayor Bill de Blasio. But first, the proposal has to go through a lengthy process, including a public hearing.
A day after he declared a narrow victory in a referendum vote that radically expands presidential powers, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is criticizing elections observers and their concerns about the fairness of the vote.
Decrying a "crusader mentality," Erdogan told a crowd of his supporters that the international monitors should "know their place," according to Reuters. Erdogan added that Turkey did not "see, hear or acknowledge" the reports of irregularities from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.
Preliminary returns say the presidential proposal passed by just 51 percent of the vote.
The European monitor released preliminary findings about Sunday's poll, saying the vote "took place on an unlevel playing field and the two sides of the campaign did not have equal opportunities."
Its report states that "while the technical aspects of the referendum were well administered and referendum day proceeded in an orderly manner, late changes in counting procedures removed an important safeguard and were contested by the opposition." The OSCE also said the vote did not meet standards set by the Council of Europe.
Allegations of vote rigging are uncommon in Turkey, Soner Cagaptay of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy tells NPR. "We don't know whether the amount of vote fraud was significant enough to change the outcome — or more than 1 percent — but definitely something happened."
But in a country that is deeply divided, "where it's almost half and half for and against Erdogan, if you even have allegations of voter fraud, whether or not it happened, his legitimacy will be completely and constantly questioned by that half that does not vote for him."
That could present problems for Erdogan in the future, Cagaptay says.
Acting State Department spokesperson Mark Toner said U.S. officials have noted the OSCE's concerns, according to Reuters. "We look forward to OSCE/ODIHR's final report, which we understand will take several weeks."
Considering how tilted critics called the campaign, NPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul says many were surprised at how close the vote was.
"It's close enough that the opposition says it's going to challenge alleged irregularities," he says. "It might be an uphill fight. It could be days or longer before we know the final results."
The new framework expands Erdogan's powers and means he could potentially stay in office until 2029. As Peter explains:
"Power would be more concentrated under the presidency. "If the referendum is approved by majority vote, the office of prime minister would be abolished after the next elections, scheduled for 2019. Another body, the Council of Ministers, would also go, and all executive and administrative authority would be transferred to the president's office. ... "The change would increase Erdogan's influence over who runs for Parliament. "Cabinet ministers would no longer have to be members of Parliament, and the Parliament would not have power over Cabinet appointments — ministers would be appointed directly by the president."
People who voted "Yes" say concentrating power in the hands of the presidency will make the country more stable, while critics say it will fundamentally undercut Turkey's democracy.
Cagaptay says Erdogan "has become the most powerful person in the country's history in at least a century."
LOS ANGELES (AP) — An appeals court says Los Angeles police violated the rights of a man arrested inside Sandra Bullock's home when they obtained his consent to search his home and recovered illegal automatic firearms.
The 2nd District Court of Appeal ruled Tuesday that police detectives violated Joshua James Corbett's rights to remain silent during a police interrogation, and his right against an unlawful search of his home. Corbett was arrested in June 2014 inside Bullock's home, and he has been charged with felony stalking.
Corbett was unarmed at the Oscar winner's home, but police later found several automatic weapons and illegal tracer ammunition in his home.
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge threw out evidence supporting the weapons charges last year after determining Corbett didn't give officers permission to search his home.
BEIJING (CBSNewYork) — China is rolling out a high-tech plan to give all of its 1.4 billion citizens a personal score, based on how they behave.
But there are consequences if a score gets too low, and for some that’s cause for concern, CBS2’s Ben Tracy reported Tuesday.
When Liu Hu recently tried to book a flight, he was told he was banned from flying because he was on the list of untrustworthy people. Liu is a journalist who was ordered by a court to apologize for a series of tweets he wrote and was then told his apology was insincere.
“I can’t buy property. My child can’t go to a private school,” he said. “You feel you’re being controlled by the list all the time.”
And the list is now getting longer as every Chinese citizen is being assigned a social credit score — a fluctuating rating based on a range of behaviors. It’s believed that community service and buying Chinese-made products can raise your score. Fraud, tax evasion and smoking in non-smoking areas can drop it.
China’s growing network of surveillance cameras makes all of this possible.
“It can recognize more than 4,000 vehicles,” Xu Li said.
Li is the CEO of Sensetime, one of China’s most successful artificial intelligence companies. It has created smart cameras for the government that can help catch criminals, but also track average citizens.
“We can tell whether it is an adult, a child, male or female,” Li said.
Ken Dewoskin has studied China’s economic and political culture for more than three decades. He says how the new scoring system truly works is kept secret and could be easily abused by the government.
Tracy: “How far into people’s daily mundane activities does this go?”
Dewoskin: “Well, I think that the government and the people running the plan would like it to go as deeply as possible to determine how to allocate benefits and also how to impact and shape their behavior.”
The fear, of course, it that the government may use this social credit scoring system to punish people that it deems not sufficiently loyal to the communist party, Tracy reported. And trying to clear your name or fight your score is nearly impossible, because there’s no due process.
DURHAM, N.C. (CBSNewYork/AP) — Hall of Fame Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski is stepping away from the team to have lower back surgery.
The school announced Monday that the procedure is scheduled for Friday, with an anticipated recovery time of four weeks.
Krzyzewski will coach Wednesday night’s game against Georgia Tech before handing off to associate head coach Jeff Capel for Saturday’s home game against Boston College.
Krzyzewski, 69, will have a fragment of a herniated disk removed at Duke University Hospital. The school says Krzyzewski tried several treatment options during the past month before deciding on surgery.
Krzyzewski said in a statement that he consulted with the university’s medical team and “together, we have determined that surgery is the best course of action at this time.” He says the Blue Devils will “be in the capable hands” of Capel and assistants Nate James and Jon Scheyer.
“As soon as the doctors clear me to do so, I look forward to returning and giving our team 100 (percent) of my energy and attention, which is certainly something that they deserve,” he said.
The winningest men’s coach in Division I history had four surgeries during the offseason to replace his left knee, repair his left ankle and fix a hernia. He squeezed those procedures into a busy summer in which he also led the U.S. Olympic team to the gold medal in Rio de Janeiro.
“To be sure, the entire Duke community is supportive and eager to get Mike back as soon as possible,” Duke athletic director Kevin White said. “His health is paramount, and he will get the best possible care in the world by the Duke medical team. With the proper recovery time, we look forward to Mike doing what he does best — leading and teaching — very soon.”
Capel — a former Duke guard who went 175-110 in nine years coaching at Virginia Commonwealth and Oklahoma — previously took over for Krzyzewski when he missed a trip to Georgia Tech last February because of dehydration and high blood pressure.
That victory in Atlanta marked the first time Krzyzewski did not travel with his team since the 1994-95 season, when he missed the final 19 games due to back surgery and exhaustion. Those Blue Devils went 4-15 during that span and became the last Duke team to miss the NCAA Tournament.
Monday’s announcement marks the latest twist in an already drama-filled season for a team voted No. 1 in the preseason on the strength of a lineup led by preseason AP All-American guard Grayson Allen and four immediate-impact freshmen.
MORE: Duke Suspends Grayson Allen Indefinitely After Tripping Opponent
On Saturday, the Blue Devils (12-2) were routed at Virginia Tech in the first game of Allen’s indefinite suspension for tripping yet another opponent . And those freshmen — Harry Giles, Jayson Tatum, Marques Bolden and Frank Jackson — have played in the same game only three times because of various injuries.
The Blue Devils dropped three spots to No. 8 — their lowest ranking of the season — in the AP Top 25 released Monday.

MOSCOW (AP) — The Russian Olympic Committee says an athlete banned for doping has been accredited as a coach for the Pyeongchang Olympics.
According to an ROC list of 80 coaches it says received International Olympic Committee accreditation, Sergei Chudinov is listed as the only skeleton coach.
That's despite Chudinov being banned from the Olympics for life by an IOC disciplinary panel in November.
The IOC ruled Chudinov was part of a Russian doping scheme at the 2014 Olympics and ordered he was "ineligible to be accredited in any capacity" for future Olympics.
The Russia team is formally banned by the IOC for doping but 169 Russian athletes are allowed to compete as "Olympic Athletes from Russia" in neutral uniforms under the Olympic flag.
PARIS (AP) — Survivors and families of victims of the deadly 2015 attack on Paris' Bataclan concert hall have brought a case before France's administrative court to find out why French soldiers stationed nearby were ordered not to intervene when Islamic State gunmen stormed the venue.
The new procedure Wednesday seeks to expose who was responsible in the French government for the soldiers' actions. It comes one month after victims filed a legal complaint with the same goal.
During the attacks, eight soldiers standing near the Bataclan as part of an internal security operation were ordered not to use their weapons. The government later clarified the rules of engagement for its military in similar situations.
The attack on the Bataclan and other Paris venues on Nov. 13, 2015, killed 130 people and wounded hundreds.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov arrived in North Korea on Thursday for talks with senior officials.
The visit comes amid a flurry of diplomatic efforts by Pyongyang, Seoul and Washington to restore a meeting between US President Donald Trump and North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un, originally scheduled for June 12 in Singapore but later canceled by Trump.
What happened
Lavrov met with his North Korean counterpart Ri Yong Ho and others at the Supreme People's Assembly building in the North Korean capital.
Lavrov and his deputy Igor Morgulov paid their respects at a monument to Soviet soldiers in Pyongyang's Moranbong Park.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said earlier Lavrov and Ri were expected to discuss "vital issues of bilateral relations and key international and regional issues."
Further details of Lavrov's schedule in Pyongyong were not disclosed.

Mayor Mike Purzycki announced that the City of Wilmington, with assistance from the New Castle County government, will undertake a random inspection process for the more than 40 private businesses that produce industrial waste in Wilmington and the county.
Purzycki said the industrial waste from the companies is sent daily to Wilmington’s Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) on Hay Road to be processed.
In late February, Purzycki directed that random inspections be instituted to improve the process for ensuring that businesses do not exceed hazardous waste discharge limits in the liquids they send to the waste treatment plant.

If the businesses exceed those limits, they may be in violation of permits granted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC). The new inspection process began in early March.
Purzycki said Wilmington is required to report its periodic inspection results, as well as those conducted by the County government, to the EPA and DNREC. However, he said, it is Wilmington, not New Castle County, that is held accountable by the Federal and State agencies for any inefficiencies in the process because Wilmington owns the WWTP. That’s why the Mayor said Wilmington sought and received cooperation from the County’s Department of Special Services in adopting a revised inspection program.
However, Wilmington, not New Castle County, is held accountable by the federal and state agencies for any inefficiencies in the process because Wilmington owns the waste plant. That’s why the mayor said Wilmington sought and received cooperation from the county’s Department of Special Services in adopting a revised inspection program.
“From an environmental perspective, it is imperative that we monitor these facilities efficiently,” said Purzycki. “It is unclear to me why a scheduled and announced inspection system was used for many years, but it has been corrected and I am grateful to our Public Works Department and to the County’s Special Services Department for working together to improve the process by which we hold these private facilities accountable.”
A recently-completed Federal, state and city investigation, conducted over several years, resulted in a guilty plea in February by a Wilmington company—International Petroleum Corporation—for violating the Clean Water Act for allowing hazardous chemicals to flow to the waste plant.
“Our job is to establish the most efficient government system possible for the best delivery of programs and services,” said Purzycki. “But, sometimes you learn through other circumstances that something is not working correctly or needs to be changed. That’s what happened here, and the City and our County partners are operating a better system today to ensure that all laws are followed.”

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Arkansas lawmakers said Tuesday they're working on a "bathroom bill" targeting transgender people, despite warnings from the Republican governor that such a measure isn't needed and could harm the state.
A one-sentence bill was filed by two GOP state senators stating only that it addresses "gender identity and bathroom privileges" without any specifics. But co-sponsor Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield said it'll require people to use public bathrooms that correspond to the sex on their birth certificate.
"If they were born a male, that's where they've got to use the bathroom," Stubblefield said.
A similar law in North Carolina has drawn widespread criticism and boycotts from businesses, and prompted the NBA to pull this weekend's All-Star Game out of Charlotte. The state's Democratic governor on Tuesday proposed a compromise to repeal the measure. A bathroom bill being considered in Texas has also prompted a backlash, with the NFL suggesting that Texas could be passed over for future Super Bowl sites if the proposal becomes law.
Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson repeated his opposition to pursuing a similar measure in Arkansas.
"I have consistently said that there is no need for a North Carolina type bathroom bill in Arkansas," Hutchinson said in a statement. "It is unclear as to the specifics of the proposed legislation but if it similar to North Carolina's, I view the bill as unnecessary and potentially harmful."
The nation's largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights group also urged lawmakers to drop the proposal.
"Proponents of anti-trans legislation are invoking a boogeyman that simply does not exist - the reality is that transgender people just want to simply live their everyday lives," Kendra Johnson, Arkansas director for the Human Rights Campaign. "Arkansas should not make the mistake North Carolina made."
Stubblefield and GOP Sen. Greg Standridge, who also sponsored the measure, said they weren't concerned about a backlash from businesses. They also said they expect more proposals from other lawmakers in the majority-Republican Legislature.
"It's a definite thing that there's going to be a bathroom bill pursued," Standridge said. "We just don't know if it's going to be our bill or someone else's bill."

Apparently, it’s never to early to launch a strike in the Los Angeles Lakers’ Troll Wars. On Monday, ahead of a game against the Indiana Pacers at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, rookie Kyle Kuzma stretched the boundaries of battle into breakfast.
Kuz hopped on Instagram to capture Zo using a napkin as a plate, while the 20-year-old point guard used a proper plate to eat his bacon and eggs.
“This dude ain’t got no house manners,” Kuzma lamented.
The Crown Prince of Chino Hills protested, going so far as to bang on his plate to prove Kuzma wrong. Kyle, meanwhile, kept trying to show Lonzo that he should grab another for his waffle.
“Yo, what is wrong with you?” Kuz wondered. “This dude is, you’re sick”
With 47 NBA games under his belt, Ball is now a Rookie In Name Only. But as far as his table manners are concerned, the kid still has a lot to learn.

Telstra’s business customers will be able to make native voice calls over the telco’s network from within Microsoft’s Office 365 under a deal unveiled today.
‘Telstra Calling for Office 365’ will support calls from within Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams.
“Calling for Office 365 brings the full scope of Office 365’s cloud productivity and collaboration apps – including video conferencing and meeting broadcast capabilities – alongside Telstra voice calling,” Telstra’s executive director of global products, Michelle Bendschneider, said in a statement.
“By combining what have traditionally been separate collaboration channels, we’re helping to increase productivity while simplifying the experience for employees.”
More than 200 of the telco’s customers have taken part in a preview program over the past six months. More than 30 customers and partners are currently participating in an early adopter program, according to Telstra.
“We’re excited to be partnering with Telstra to bring this pure cloud offering to our customers in Australia and enabling all components of our modern workplace solution with the addition of voice services,” said Microsoft Australia’s COO, Rachel Bondi.
The new service will be available from mid-2018.
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Police have arrested a third suspect after opponents to the Dakota Access pipeline hung a banner from the roof of the U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis during the Minnesota Vikings’ season finale against the Chicago Bears.
The 27-year-old woman is accused of obstructing legal process. Police haven’t released details of her role in the incident Sunday afternoon.
Two other people accused of sneaking onto a truss in the roof and rappelling down to unfurl the banner have been arrested for trespass. Formal charges are pending.
The game wasn’t interrupted, but eight rows of fans seated below the banner were cleared as a precaution.
The Dakota Access pipeline would carry oil from North Dakota to Illinois. Opponents fear it could harm the environment and American Indian artifacts. The pipeline developer disputes that.

NEW YORK (AP) — Jaroslav Halak made 31 saves after getting a vote of confidence from his coach, and the New York Islanders beat the Washington Capitals 3-1 on Monday night to snap a five-game winless streak.
Brock Nelson, Andrew Ladd and John Tavares scored goals for the Islanders, who built a 3-0 lead early in the second period and ended Washington’s four-game winning streak.
It was the second time this season that Halak held an opponent to a single goal and the third time New York has allowed one goal as a team. Halak’s strong performance came after coach Doug Weight sternly defended his goaltenders following the team’s skate Monday morning. New York was 0-3-2 over its last five games.
Braden Holtby made nine saves for the Capitals before being pulled after the Islanders scored their third goal 1:34 into the second period. Philipp Grubauer made 17 saves in relief, and Dmitry Orlov scored Washington’s only goal.
Nelson scored his ninth goal of the season 2:36 into the first period. Jason Chimera passed to Cal Clutterbuck to set up the initial shot, and Nelson picked up the rebound and banked the puck off the inside of Holtby’s pad.
The Islanders appeared to score again when Anders Lee pushed the puck over the goal line, but officials waved off the goal, and a challenge by Weight was unsuccessful.
New York went ahead 2-0 36 seconds into the second period when Calvin de Haan slid the puck toward center ice and Ladd tapped it in.
Tavares scored 58 seconds later, taking advantage when Holtby got out of position.
Orlov scored with 11:37 left in the game. He capitalized on a 2-on-1 rush and fired a one-timer past Halak.
NOTES: Capitals RW T.J. Oshie missed his third consecutive game with an upper-body injury. Oshie skated at the Capitals’ practice facility in Arlington, Virginia, on Monday for the second straight day. … Islanders D Johnny Boychuk sat out his third straight game with an undisclosed injury. Boychuk participated in the team’s morning skate and was labeled a game-time decision. … Forwards Alan Quine and Shane Prince were scratches for the Islanders. … D Taylor Chorney was a healthy scratch for the Capitals.

JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) -- For one last time, St. Anthony's High School opened its doors to Jersey City and offered a final farewell to its friends and family.
The basketball powerhouse in New Jersey that Hall of Fame coach Bob Hurley led to 28 state titles and four national crowns held its last official function Wednesday night, a reunion of sorts for alumni, players, coaches, teachers and friends of the little Roman Catholic school that is closing after losing the decades-long fight against declining attendance and rising costs.
The school in the shadow of the magnificent New York City skyline sent more than 150 players to Division I basketball programs, including Hurley's sons Bobby and Danny who are now Division I coaches.
Even more importantly the school offered low tuition that afforded the children of the poor a chance for an education with a mission to build character in students.
The last group of seniors graduated a couple of weeks ago. The roughly 100-plus remaining students who will be entering their sophomore to senior years in September have had their roughly $6,100 tuition grandfathered by surrounding Roman Catholic high schools operated by the Archdiocese of Newark.
''It's the end of a lot of things,'' Hurley said in the auditorium where a couple of hundred people mingled and reminisced surrounded by tables full of trophies, memorabilia, yearbooks, press clippings and text books covering almost every subject.
If you wanted one, you took it, although the coach was hoping his former players would get the championship trophies. ''It's not an end to the relationship. Those will remain.''
Every time Hurley spoke, someone walked over to say hello, talk about old times, or even to get a photograph or an autograph.
The 69-year-old Hurley plans to run a not-profit basketball clinic in Jersey City, renting the gym where his Friars used to practice and play games.
The redness in Hurley's eyes was a clear indication how hard he was taking the closing. He seemed to be at a wake, although many times his friends and players brought up something that had him smiling.
Doug Reed, who played on Hurley's 82 championship team, said this was a school worth saving.
''The one thing I will always say was that St. Anthony's was always a family, and always will be a family,'' said Reed, who works for NJ Transit.
''The school is big enough that we are known all over the country and sometimes all over the world because of basketball. But it is also small enough that we knew each other.''
There is a loyalty, too, for the school that opened in 1952. Gold balloons on the stage marked the opening and closing years.
''It's difficult,'' said Rosemary McFadden, who chaired the development committee that has raised the money that kept the school alive.
''It's the end of an era, but we had a lot of time to prepare for it. I think people are in a good place. We are celebrating the success.''
There was a little bit of a party atmosphere. There was pizza and wings, cookies, beer, wine and other goodies.
Mary Anne Rochford, class of 1979, drove from Calabash, North Carolina, to attend. Her brothers, Patrick, Danny and John, played basketball for the Friars and she was a cheerleader.
''When I heard our beloved school was closing there was no other option but to drive up,'' said Rochford, who took the time to walk into her homeroom from 1975 and remember the teachers and students who were there.
Willie Banks, the No. 3 pick in the 1987 Major League baseball draft, said he had to come back, just to walk to his locker one more time.
It was a feeling shared by many.
''It was a nice small school that interacted with all different ethnic groups, but the constant was there was always discipline, great basketball and a good education,'' said Richie Freda, who played on Hurley's first championship team in 1967. ''That will be missed because there are not many schools like this anymore.
Peter Miraldo, a mathematics teacher, is one of the lucky members of St. Anthony's faculty. There were 18 teachers this year. A few are going to retire. He said about 14-15 had to look for jobs and he believes he is one of four who found one. He will work at a charter school in Newark.
Miraldo said the closing probably affected the ones who will be seniors next year.

AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- Auburn's leading rebounder is a 6-foot-3 transfer from Presbyterian College. The best shot blocker and tallest starter is a 6-foot-7 guy whose other college options included MIT and Yale.
The 11th-ranked Tigers are having their best season in decades and have built a two-game lead in the Southeastern Conference despite being undersized and short-handed. They're holding their own just fine around the basket, too.
That's largely thanks to the outsized play of cerebral shot blocker Anfernee McLemore and 6-3, 225-pound power forward Desean Murray, a former All-Big South Conference performer who sat out last season after transferring from Presbyterian.
''I'm sure they would think it's a big disadvantage with me being 6-3 and playing the 4'' position, Murray said. ''I mean, I guess I've got to come every night and play hard so that's not the case.''
That strategy is working well for Auburn (20-2, 8-1 SEC), which hosts Vanderbilt (8-14, 2-7) Saturday night. The Tigers haven't been ranked this high since 2000 and are chasing just the program's third SEC title and first since 1999.
They've done it all without center Austin Wiley and 6-7 forward Danjel Purifoy, neither of whom have played this season amid an internal review of the program following the arrest of associate head coach Chuck Person on federal bribery, conspiracy and fraud charges.
It has left a scrappy team that often faces significant size mismatches but can also run, shoot and score with anybody in the league.
The Tigers lead the SEC in scoring at 85.7 points per game, which would make them the league's highest scoring team since Kentucky averaged 91.4 points in 1996. They're are also tops in offensive rebounding while making and attempting more 3-pointers than any other league team.
A "Celebration of Life" was held on Wednesday to remember the three women -- Dr. Jennifer Gray Golick, Christine Loeber and Dr. Jennifer Gonzales Shushereba -- who died at a veterans center in Yountville. At the memorial, Yountville Mayor John Dunbar said the three victims had an "unwavering commitment to helping others."
WILLIAMS, Ariz. (AP) — Two orphaned bear cubs have been placed in the care of a wildlife rescue park near the Grand Canyon after their mother was euthanized.
The wildlife park Bearizona in Williams said Wednesday the 4-month-old black bears were rescued from a treetop in Arizona's White Mountains. The cubs were so small a climber was able to lower them to safety in a backpack.
The park says the Arizona Game and Fish Department was forced to euthanize the cubs' mother after twice removing her from a residential area in the town of Pinetop-Lakeside.
Bearizona says the animal had been drawn to the neighborhood after a woman there began feeding it daily. A day after the bear was put down, authorities reportedly learned it was the mother of the two cubs.
BOSTON (AP) — The Latest on Massachusetts Gaming Commission review of Wynn casino license (all times local):
3:45 p.m.
A Massachusetts Gaming Commission investigator says information about a $7.5 million settlement was kept from Massachusetts officials when they were reviewing the suitability of casino magnate Steve Wynn in 2013 as his company sought a casino license in the state.
Karen Wells made the statement Wednesday as the commission opened its investigation into a report by The Wall Street Journal that a number of women said they were harassed or assaulted by Wynn. One case led to a $7.5 million settlement.
Wynn, whose company is building a $2.4 billion casino outside Boston, has denied the allegations.
Commission Chairman Stephen Crosby said that any decision, including possibly revoking the license, will be based on facts gleaned during the commission's ongoing probe.
Gambling regulators in Nevada said Tuesday they are also investigating Wynn.

Massachusetts gambling regulators are holding a special meeting to discuss sexual misconduct allegations against casino magnate Steve Wynn, whose company is building a $2.4 billion casino outside Boston.
The Massachusetts Gaming Commission will receive an update on an investigation Wednesday.
Republican Gov. Charlie Baker says if the allegations are true, Wynn would "fail to meet the suitability standard under the state gaming law."
Gambling regulators in Nevada said Tuesday they are also investigating Wynn.
The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that a number of women said they were harassed or assaulted by Wynn, and that one case led to a $7.5 million settlement. Wynn has denied the allegations.
Under the 2011 Massachusetts casino law, a license can be suspended or revoked if a licensee is found "unsuitable to operate a gaming establishment."
HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — A federal appeals court has been asked to allow a class-action lawsuit against the Veterans Affairs Department by veterans who say they became ill from radiation exposure after responding to a 1966 accident involving U.S. hydrogen bombs in Spain.
Yale Law School students in Connecticut filed the request Monday with the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims on behalf of veterans who sought disability benefits from the VA but were denied.
The students represent Air Force veteran Victor Skaar, of Nixa, Missouri, and want to expand the lawsuit to include other veterans.
VA officials did not immediately return messages Monday.
Radioactive plutonium was released near Palomares, Spain, in January 1966, after a U.S. B-52 bomber and refueling plane crashed. Four hydrogen bombs crashed, but there were no nuclear explosions.

SOLOLA, Guatemala (AP) — The law works as it has for centuries in the Guatemalan indigenous community of Solola: Townsfolk bring grievances and local authorities make rulings, usually with a speed unheard of in a country where justice is often delayed, if it comes at all. At one recent weekly court session, Maria Micaela Panjoc, baby in arms, came with a request for paternity payments. Others sought help with land disputes. Andres Xelp wanted the judges to force his son to move back home. The generally non-partisan leaders of local Mayan communities hear the cases, trying to find quick resolutions when they can and sometimes passing cases over to formal prosecutors when they cannot – as in the case of a young woman speaking the Kaqchikel language who said she’d been raped. The Solola court alone handled 3,000 cases last year. For generations, outsiders have looked down on indigenous law courts, as they have on the native cultures themselves. Some 40 percent of Guatemala’s 17 million people identify themselves as indigenous and they are pushing for wider respect for the traditional ways in which their cultures deal with their differences, though opposition remains strong within the country’s non-indigenous communities. Guatemala’s Constitutional Court already has accepted some rulings by indigenous courts and there’s a move to formally amend the country’s constitution to recognize them. An earlier measure to do that came two votes short in congress, with opposition coming from conservatives and from business interests that said they feared legal confusion if different systems co-exist. Members of congress on Wednesday are scheduled to discuss the proposed constitutional amendment to recognize indigenous justice as part of the country’s judicial system. At least 105 of 158 legislators must approve the proposal for it to pass. The idea has gained support from national Attorney General Thelma Aldana, as well as Ivan Velaszuqez, who heads the U.N. Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala that has been assisting in corruption investigations in the country. “Guatemala has to be a place where all its inhabitants belong,” said Velazquez, who visited Solola to view the court process. The formal legal system has often exploited or ignored indigenous Guatemalans, who were legally required to perform forced labor well into the 20th century and who generally found it nearly impossible to pay for lawyers. Even now, only 10 percent of the country’s townships have prosecutors’ offices. In Solola, Mayor Tomas Saloj presided over hearings in a town hall decorated with the 20 figures representing the Mayan calendar – 20 days per month, 18 months per year. On the table that served as the judge’s bench were a candle and a glass of water, an invitation for the wisdom of dead ancestors to enter. Punishments can include restitution, community labor, banishment or whippings: Two braided leather whips hang in the Solola town hall as a reminder. Agustin Bocel, a town spokesman, recalled a case of attempted rape in which the attacker was sentenced to nine lashes of a whip – at the insistence of his own mother, one for each month she carried him, to remind him of the shame he caused her. Bocel said the man has never caused problems again. Tomas Guarcas, the mayor of nearby Pixabaj, defended the practice. “Whipping is a punishment that is like educating children, without violating human rights,” he said, adding that the punishment is usually applied by “by one of the offender’s relatives, the mother, father or in-laws.” Indigenous Congressman Amilcar Pop said the use of floggings is increasingly discouraged, however. “This type of mechanism is something that has to be controlled and avoided,” Pop said. Aldana, the attorney general, said she sees no contradiction between the indigenous system and the formal courts. The indigenous courts, she said, “have helped maintain the peace” and helped “reduce pressure on the regular justice system and its budget.” Victoria Chuj is one of just three women among the 71 mayors in the province of Solola, of which the town of Solola is part. She carries her wooden staff – the badge of her authority, decorated with four tokens representing the four directions – with pride. “The staff has to be good and straight so that, like justice, it cannot be bent,” Chuj said.

CRANBERRY, Pa. (AP/WATE) — Teen clothing retailer rue21 is closing about one-third of its stores nationwide, including some East Tennessee locations.
The company says it wants to focus more on its online business.
The privately held company is shutting nearly 400 stores, leaving it more than 700 stores in 48 states.
The company is based in Cranberry, north of Pittsburgh. In a Facebook post, it called the decision to close the stores “difficult but necessary.” Like many brick-and-mortar retailers, it has been battling declining mall traffic amid strong competition online.
The company didn’t say how soon the stores will close, though its website is promoting store-closing sales.
East Tennessee stores closing:
Knoxville: 4231 Sam Walton Way
Alcoa: 207 Hamilton Crossing Drive
Crossville: 114 N. Main Street
Greeneville: 1327 Tusculum Blvd
Kingsport: 2101 Fort Henry Drive
TAIPEI (Taiwan News) – The U.S. embassy in Beijing published a Fourth of July message on their official Weibo webpage on July 3, which led to numerous netizens to ask for U.S. salvation, reports say.
Chinese authorities who sensor China's internet more systematically than anyone else, were slow to respond which allowed the post to be visible from when it was published at 1.47 p.m. yesterday until late-morning today.
In a Weibo post that explained the Fourth of July to the Chinese audience yesterday afternoon, a host of netizens replied with comments of support and admiration of the U.S. government.
"Happy U.S. empire day" said one, "The U.S. can save everything in China" said another, according to the Liberty Times.
"Please rescue the Chinese government from high house prices that drink the blood of young people" implored a netizen.
"I wish one day that China with Japan and South Korea can enjoy democratic values as well as U.S. military protection" hoped another.
Despite growing controls on the internet and especially Weibo in China, the Chinese government was slow to delete the posts, leading for some to ask why the Chinese government does not dare to delete them, according to the Liberty Times.
The post was deleted during sometime the late morning of July 4.
July 4 is the U.S.'s national day, which celebrates the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, a pronouncement of secession by 13 U.S. colonies from the British Empire.
The always-on hyper-connected world we live in brings with it huge potential, some of it good and some of it bad
The always-on hyper-connected world we live in brings with it huge potential, some of it good and some of it bad. The age of hyper-connectivity has enabled the Internet of Things (IoT) to succeed, which promises more personalised and automated services, optimised resource utilisation and added convenience, but have we ignored the risks and merely focused on the hype?
The number of connected devices has grown at an unprecedented rate with current estimates at between 6-12 billion devices. This number seems enormous but if you doubt it, I suggest you login into your home router and look at how many devices are registered – you may be surprised when you see your TVs, amplifiers and heating thermostats featuring on the list.
We already have cars that can drive themselves and buildings that can configure their environmental control systems based on your presence. The amount of machine-to-machine communication going on around us is growing all the time, but in many cases, we haven’t considered ‘security’ to be part of our buying or implementation processes.
IoT devices, by their very nature, must be easy to deploy and use, but we should not forget that these devices are just small computers. How many of us would plug a computer straight into the Internet using the (old) original, un-patched version of an OS, with no firewall or security devices to protect it, using the default username and password? Not many, but this is what is happening in many cases with IoT devices.
Emerging threats
2016 brought the darker side of the connected world more sharply into focus, with the proliferation of botnets, and weaponised DDoS services, based on IoT devices. If we think back to the early noughties DDoS attacks were often generated by large botnets of compromised end-user’s workstations, because of multiple vulnerabilities and a lack of security awareness.
Cyber-criminals have realised that IoT devices offer a significant capability, just waiting to be exploited in a similar way, and we all saw how thousands of relatively small, innocuous CCTV cameras and DVRs could be leveraged to generate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks at 500Gbps or greater, affecting the availability of Internet services from many well-known Internet brands.
Many IoT devices have good connectivity on unmonitored network segments, and enough processing capability to drive a significant volume of DDoS attack traffic. Attacks from these devices are responsible for some of the increased scale and frequency of DDoS activity reported in Arbor Networks’ annual Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report (WISR). And, DDoS is just one use-case for compromised IoT devices – more on that later….
The layered defence strategy
Compromised IoT devices offer attackers a new way to threaten the availability of the Internet services we use, but the best way to protect our businesses has stayed the same. Most businesses today are reliant on the data and application services they utilise via the Internet, and availability issues can be very costly. To combat today’s DDoS threat, businesses and governments alike need to implement a multilayer DDoS protection strategy.
Multi-layered defences incorporate both an on-premise and cloud or ISP-based component. The on-premise component allows businesses to detect and mitigate attacks immediately, before there is any service impact. However, the on-premise solution can’t deal with increasingly common, large attacks that can saturate Internet connectivity, and this is where the cloud or ISP-based service steps in – to deal with the higher magnitude attacks. The good news is that many more enterprises are adopting layered defence. Arbor’s WISR showed that 30% of enterprise organisations had adopted this model in 2016, up from 23% in 2015. &
Putting the right defences in place does require investment, and there are many competing priorities in businesses for both IT and security budget. But given the dependence most businesses now have on connectivity for interaction with customers, partners and suppliers, these kinds of defences are essential. Incorporating availability threats into business and IT risk assessment processes can help to quantify the potential impact of a DDoS attack, helping to prioritise investment, and the WISR report shows that around two-thirds of enterprises have now taken this step.
The tip of the iceberg
The combination of DDoS and IoT devices will undoubtedly continue to make the news headlines in the latter part of 2017, as we see even larger attacks causing problems for both service providers and enterprises. However, DDoS is only one of the ways in which IoT devices can be exploited. We are already seeing compromised IoT devices being used as proxies to obfuscate the original source of traffic. And, if you are thinking that the risk to IoT is limited to those devices that are exposed to the Internet – think again.
Windows malware that looks to scan local networks for IoT devices to infect is already a reality. This would allow attackers to gain a foothold within a network, using our IoT devices, so that they could then move on to target other resources inside or outside of our networks.
The hyperconnected world provides us with some amazing opportunities, mostly positive, but some negative, such as the use of IoT devices to amplify existing threats and create new ones. One thing we can all do is try to avoid becoming a part of the problem, and the solution here is simply to implement good IT security hygiene when we deploy IoT devices.
Improving the security of IoT devices and preventing their compromise are key goals of the security industry and the manufacturers of these devices, but until that is done, and it may take some time, everyone needs to protect themselves from the threats we know that are out there, and DDoS is a significant and growing threat.

KINGSPORT, TN (WJHL) – Thrill seekers in Kingsport got to take a dip in near freezing water Sunday afternoon, all for a good cause.
Dozens came out to the Kingsport Aquatic Center for the inaugural Polar Plunge.
The event helped kick off the new year and the city’s centennial.
Participants signed up and then made teams to donate money to local and national charities
A best friend duo tells us they were excited to ring in the new year in a different way.
“It was freezing, it was definitely very cold, and my body was numb. It was something different, and we’ve never done it before and I just feel like that was a great way to start out the new year,” Gracie Bass and Madison Grizzle said.
The water was certainly cold at 43 degrees. The aquatic center raised over $500 for charities.

Trophy Spring Stripers On The Jersey Coast
Many anglers think of fall as “striper season,” but there are instances throughout the spring and summer when your odds of catching a truly big cow are actually better.
“That’s exactly the case with the May striper fishery out of Barnegat Inlet, New Jersey,” said Capt. Dave DeGennaro of the Waretown charter vessel Hi Flier (www.hiflier.com). “We have a 13-mile stretch of ocean between the inlet and Lavallette that gives up a ton of 30- to 50-pound bass this time of year. It’s reliable trophy action and a lot different than you might imagine.”
Indeed, it is. Stripers here generally set up in 50- to 65-foot depths paralleling Long Beach Island State Park. Rather than stalk baitfish schools, the big fish spread out. In response, sharp skippers troll to cover more water.
“The bottom here is mundane; no real structure, no drop-offs,” said DeGennaro. “It lacks character in terms of bass cover so we use bunker spoons to target these cows. Every ten minutes, we’ll mark a big fish on our electronics, but that single scratch often translates into a vicious strike. ”
No one seems sure why the linesiders favor this bland stretch, but no one is complaining, either. Captains that can troll big spoons effectively rarely get shut out and most work up two to five trophy fish per half-day trip. Some days, the action is considerably better.
“I put out a pair of Tony Maja E-Z Out-Rodders and 8-foot rods with soft tips,” explained DeGennaro, who pursues these fish aboard a World Cat 25CC catamaran with twin 150 Suzuki Four Stroke engines. “With the rods at a 90-degree angle to the water, there’s not much upward pressure on the spoons, so they’ll run deep without a drail. My favorite offering is #4 Tony Maja (www.tonymajaproducts.com) in white or chartreuse split (half chartreuse, half green). It has a great slow-roll action stripers can’t resist. It comes with an 8-ounce keel weight you can swap out for 12 ounces to help keep the spoon riding down near the bottom.”
DeGennaro uses 80-pound-test, high-visibility Dacron for backing, 300 feet of 40-pound Monel wire, and 30 feet of 60-pound test High Seas Quattro monofilament. He attaches the spoon with a Rosco #56, 150-pound Duo-Lock Snap. Don’t use a snap swivel, he cautions, it hurts the spoon’s action.
Catches during this big bass bonanza are best on moving water, so concentrate your efforts when the current pushes hardest. Trolling speed varies between 2.5 knots and 3.5 knots. Your spoons are working right when the rod tips are pumping hardest.
“These are big, beautiful fish,” said DeGennaro, “but keep in mind they are breeders. It’s okay to toss some of the big girls back.”
Barnegat Inlet is easily accessible via Barnegat Bay, from Beach Haven from the south or Manasquan to the north. Holiday Harbor Marina (www.holidayharbormarinanj.com) and Long Key Marina (www.longkeymarina.com) in Waretown are full service operations that accommodate transients.

A July 2 report from the National Partnership for New Americans found a "shocking" 88 percent increase in citizenship application processing backlog since 2015.The report, presented at a news conference with House members Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., and Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., found that the backlog of roughly 390,000 naturalization applications has "skyrocketed" to nearly 730,000 over the past two years, during the Trump administration and the end of the Obama administration."There's been a shocking increase in the backlog. Nearly three-quarters of a million legal permanent residents eligible for citizenship are awaiting processing of their naturalization applications," Joshua Hoyt, executive director of the National Partnership for New Americans, a coalition of immigrant rights groups, told ABC News.U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the government agency that oversees the naturalization process, rejected claims made by the report."The truth is that the total number of people the U.S. naturalizes each year has remained virtually unchanged. What we're looking at is a dishonest and desperate attempt by open borders advocates to undermine the work of Homeland Security officials, law enforcement and the administration to protect the integrity of our immigration system and uphold the rule of law," U.S.C.I.S. spokesperson Michael Bars said in a statement.The report found that after applicants have submitted a 21-page naturalization application, paid a $730 application fee, and provided fingerprints for a background check, they could wait as long as 20 months for their applications to be processed."This backlog is either a consequence of bad, inefficient government that's not accountable to the people, or malevolent voter suppression that's part of the Trump administration's aggressive agenda toward immigrants," said Diego Iniguez-Lopez, the organization's policy and communication associate who authored the report.The Federation for American Immigration Reform, a conservative-leaning immigration reform group, attributed the backlog to the admission of large numbers of immigrants."It's possible that we are admitting immigrants faster than we can process them, and that suggests that perhaps we are admitting too many immigrants. Most Americans support lower levels of immigration, which would certainly help address this problem," Dave Ray, FAIR's communications director, told ABC News. "The enormous backlog is likely due to increased vetting, something that was likely not happening under the Obama administration."Ray added that a "one year-wait" for naturalization is "not in any way unreasonable.""In 1996, the wait was four to six years for a decision on the N-400 application and another 1-2 years for an oath ceremony," he said.Meanwhile, Hoyt said that naturalization ceremonies are fully-funded by application fees paid by new citizens."The U.S. spends billions of dollars in taxpayer money to pay for a literal army of immigration enforcement and border security agents. But not a dime of taxpayer money is spent to fund oath ceremonies," he said. "Those are fully paid for by people hoping to become citizens. And the government is slow-walking the process."Iniguez-Lopez said according to the report, while the number of naturalization applications has decreased in the last quarter, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has also decreased its rate of processing them and increased its denial of these applications in a manner that is "arbitrary" and "lacks geographic uniformity.""They are arbitrarily targeting people who have a constitutional right to citizenship and preventing them from becoming citizens and using their voting power," he said of the agency, which is part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.But Bars said the "current pending workload does not equate to a backlog.""It's a statistic used in the USCIS report to include every application for naturalization filed including those filed in recent days and weeks-and is being inaccurately portrayed as evidence of delays. Many of these cases, which can remain pending from one quarter to the next, are well within the processing time goal established by the agency with variances being a direct result of geography and capacity," Bars said in a statement.Hoyt added that during the Trump presidency, the agency's focus has "changed" from one of "customer service" to a mission of "preventing fraud.""(U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services) created a brand new unit, which is basically a witch-hunt to find fraud in naturalization applications and denaturalize people," he said.Bars said that combating instances of "fraud, abuse and other nefarious activities" is a "critical part" of the agency's mission."Those who obtained the great privilege of citizenship through deliberate and intentional acts of fraud have committed crimes against the American people and the U.S. government, and as such, this privilege should be revoked. Those who have cheated the system in order to undermine legitimate, law-abiding applicants seeking greater opportunity, prosperity, and security will be rightfully referred to the Department of Justice," Bars said."Nobody who obtained U.S. citizenship by deliberately assuming a false identity will be surprised to learn they are being referred to the Justice Department for denaturalization proceedings. USCIS screens for deliberate acts of fraud relating to forgery or the use of false identities, and we go to great lengths to ensure individuals aren't susceptible to instances of error, misunderstanding, or special circumstances," he said.Ray added that the agency "shouldn't be judged based on how many applications they process, but rather on how many applications they process right.""This report is written to make it sound like immigrants are being denied a right. Immigrants don't have a right to citizenship. They can apply and will be granted if they qualify. Those who don't qualify may be denied, even if eligible to submit an application," he said. "Citizenship fraud has long been a problem and it's high time the issue was addressed."Meanwhile, Hoyt outlined five steps the National Partnership for New Americans is taking to address the findings of the group's report."First, we released the report to show that there's a likelihood that the government is intentionally slow-walking the [naturalization] process. Then, we informed Lofgren and Gutierrez, who released a sign-on letter to petition U.S.C.I.S. to invest resources to return processing times to an average of six months or less," he said.Hoyt added that the group has additionally informed "mayors all over the country" of the report, who are "circulating a sign-on letter" to U.S.C.I.S. to address the concerns highlighted in the document."We've also told immigrant advocacy organizations all over the country about the report. And fifth, we're filing a Freedom of Information Act request asking for the internal communications of U.S.C.I.S. to find out if they're targeting specific religions, such as Muslims, and nationalities, such as Mexicans. We want to know if these groups are being disproportionately affected by the backlog," he said.Both Iniguez-Lopez and Hoyt added that the backlog could leave an impact on the upcoming November midterm elections."(U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services) increased the backlogs in at least 19 states and territories," Iniguez-Lopez said, pointing to states with large immigrant populations including Texas, Maryland, and Arizona.Hoyt said that these states, plus the states with the largest overall backlogs - including California, New York, and Florida, are areas in which "elections could move either way.""In high immigrant-receiving states, new citizens can help change the state's politics," he said, pointing to toss-up elections in Arizona, Florida, and Colorado where he believes the votes of new citizens could be crucial.He provided the example of Florida, where there are open seats for governor and U.S. senator, but where "88,000 people have submitted citizenship applications that are still being processed."But even if these applications are not processed in time for the upcoming midterms, the National Partnership for New Americans is hoping that they will be ready in time for the 2020 presidential election."We're encouraging people to apply for citizenship as soon as possible," Hoyt said. "Their votes are going to be politically impactful."
DETROIT (AP) — Justin Abdelkader scored in the seventh round of a shootout, and Petr Mrazek stopped Tomas Hertl at the other end to give the Detroit Red Wings a 2-1 victory over the San Jose Sharks on Wednesday night.
Trevor Daley scored for the Red Wings in the third period before Kevin Labanc responded for San Jose. Gustav Nyquist, Andreas Athanasiou, Tomas Tatar and Abdelkader scored in the shootout for Detroit, while Joe Pavelski, Logan Couture and Chris Tierney scored for the Sharks.
The Red Wings had a season-high 44 shots, but San Jose salvaged a point thanks to goalie Martin Jones and Labanc's goal with 4:59 remaining. The Sharks spoiled Mrazek's bid for a third shutout in January after an extended period in Detroit's zone. Luke Glendening of the Red Wings was caught without a stick, and Labanc's wrist shot through traffic beat Mrazek high to the glove side.
Mrazek finished with 30 saves.
Daley put Detroit up 1-0 with 13:12 remaining. Jones appeared to have stopped Daley's backhander from a tough angle, but the puck dropped over his left pad and ended up in the net for the defenseman's fourth goal of the season.
The goal came moments after Pavelski hit the post at the other end.
Detroit was playing its first game after the All-Star break, while the Sharks lost the previous night at Pittsburgh. The Red Wings had their chances before Daley opened the scoring. Darren Helm was unable to convert a clean breakaway early in the second period, and Martin Frk had an open net on a third-period rebound, but the puck went wide.
San Jose defenseman Justin Braun, who was without a stick at the time, stuck out a skate and appeared to get a piece of Frk's shot.
NOTES: San Jose's Brent Burns had six shots in the first period and nine for the game. ... Labanc played his 100th NHL game. The goal was his sixth of the season.

Sharks: Visit the Columbus Blue Jackets on Friday night.
Red Wings: Visit the Carolina Hurricanes on Friday night.

HOUSTON (AP) — The Latest on the health of former President George H.W. Bush (all times local):
12:10 p.m.
A family spokesman says former President George H.W. Bush is still "responding and recovering" as doctors treat him for an infection that's spread to his blood.
Bush has been hospitalized since Sunday, a day after attending the funeral of his wife, Barbara.
Family spokesman Jim McGrath issued the update Tuesday. He says previous updates also still stand, in that the 93-year-old former president is responding to treatments and appears to be recovering.
Bush has a form of Parkinson's disease along with a history of pneumonia and other infections. He's being treated at Houston Methodist Hospital.
___
3 a.m.
A spokesman says former President George H.W. Bush is eager to get well so he can get to his summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
Jim McGrath says the 93-year-old Bush is "the most goal-oriented person on this planet."
Bush has been hospitalized in Houston with an infection, just after attending the funeral of his wife, Barbara. McGrath said Monday that Bush is "responding to treatments and appears to be recovering."
McGrath says he was admitted Sunday morning to Houston Methodist Hospital after an infection spread to his blood. He wouldn't elaborate on the 41st president's condition Monday night, saying updates will be issued "as events warrant."
Bush uses a wheelchair and an electric scooter for mobility after developing a form of Parkinson's disease.
Barbara Bush was laid to rest Saturday.
Nominated at the 2015 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards and celebrated as one of Britain’s top folk musicians, Ange Hardy has grabbed the attention of the traditional folk music world by writing new material and embracing modern technologies whilst maintaining a traditional feel.
Her rapid rise in the folk world began when her 2013 debut album Bare Foot Walk was played on BBC Radio 2.
Her 2014 album The Lament of The Black Sheep subsequently received five stars from The Telegraph which led to Arts Council England funding her 2015 album Esteeesee.
Last year’s album, Findings, was launched during a live session on the BBC Radio 2 Folk Show and was toured nationally at venues including the prestigious Sage in Gateshead.
Whether she is performing in a sold out theatre or an intimate village hall, Ange brings a level of honesty and openness to the stage that is as refreshing as it is disarming.
Her focus on vocal harmony and her pitch perfect vocal talent has led her toward adopting a live-looping pedal; a digital tape recorder at her feet that allows her to record and play back layers of vocal harmony live from the stage.
In doing so she brings her talent as a recording artist to a live performance, adding an extra dimension to an already captivating stage presence.
Between recording albums, Ange has always found time to write and release a Christmas single every year and she is currently writing new material.
She will perform at the Limelight Theatre in Aylesbury at 8pm on Friday, April 28.
Tickets cost £13, concessions £11 and can be bought online at www.qpc.org or from the box office on 01296 424332.

In the latest preview of the operating system's fall feature upgrade, Microsoft has mandated that its built-in Edge browser handle the opening of links within the Windows Mail app
Microsoft will try a new way to push Windows 10 users into running Edge, forcing links opened from the Windows Mail app and its messages to display in the browser.
Normally, links embedded in messages retrieved by the Windows Mail app open in the default browser, which may be an Edge rival if the user has set one.
In the latest preview of Windows 10's fall feature upgrade, currently known as 1809 in Microsoft's yymm label format, Microsoft has mandated that Edge assume responsibilities for opening links within messages.
"We will begin testing a change where links clicked on within the Windows Mail app will open in Microsoft Edge, which provides the best, most secure and consistent experience on Windows 10 and across your devices," announced Dona Sarkar and Brandon LeBlanc, the Microsoft employees who most often speak for the Insider preview team, in a post to a company blog last week.
The change was added to build 17623 of the "Skip Ahead" version of Windows Insider.
The Skip Ahead builds are offered to the limited number of Insider participants whom Microsoft lets continue with the latest code during the month or longer run-up to a release of one of the twice-annual feature upgrades. Microsoft will ship the spring upgrade, designated as 1803, sometime in early April.
Although Sarkar and LeBlanc trumpeted Edge's security and battery life in their post, they said nothing about what must almost certainly be the real reason for the move: To make Windows 10 users run Edge, if only in circumscribed circumstances.
Microsoft has good reason to up the pressure on users.
Since it debuted as the default within Windows 10 nearly three years ago, Edge's user share of the browsers run under the OS has been in steady decline.
In February, Edge accounted for a record-low percentage - less than 12% of all Windows 10 systems - which represented a nearly-two-percentage-point decline from the month before. And Edge's continued slide has been in the face of Windows 10's own growing share.
Windows 10 last month powered 39% of all Windows PCs. In other words, the more people who run Windows 10, the less they collectively like Edge.
The forced-link-opening maneuver wasn't Microsoft's first attempt to inflate Edge's usage. From Windows 10's mid-2015 launch, Microsoft has made it difficult to switch to a competitor as the operating system's default and has regularly reversed any user changes with new feature upgrades.
The company has also promoted Edge as a power miser, restricted its Cortana voice-activated assistant to the browser and even marketed an Edge rewards program.
None of those plays have halted the browser's decline.
It was unclear whether the Edge-related change introduced in build 17623 will remain in place long enough to appear in the 1809 feature upgrade later this year. Sarkar and LeBlanc left room for back-pedaling.
"As always, we look forward to feedback from our WIP [Windows Insider Program] community," the two wrote, implying that if customers turned thumbs down, Microsoft might rethink the maneuver.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — The Senate's top leader says it's "premature" to tout President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize in pursuing a peace deal with North Korea.
But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell chuckled as he mentioned the "chagrin" it would cause the Nobel committee to award Trump the world's most coveted diplomatic prize.
The Republican senator made the comments this week to WHAS-AM in his home state of Kentucky.
U.S. and North Korean officials are continuing talks aimed at salvaging a summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. McConnell says the U.S. should always be "skeptical" when dealing with North Korea, but says it's good that Trump and Kim could meet.
MOSCOW (AP) — Two men have been able to register their marriage in Russia, a first for the country that the Interior Ministry attributes to a bureaucratic error.
Russia doesn't recognize same-sex marriage and has a law banning the dissemination of gay "propaganda" to minors, so Pavel Stotzko and Yevgeny Voitsekhovsky's claim that their marriage was officially registered has caused an uproar.
The couple says they got married in Denmark and submitted their passports to a registrar's office, where a clerk docilely put marriage stamps on the travel documents last week.
The Interior Ministry says the passports will be withdrawn and the clerk who stamped them fired.
Russian LGBT Network, a gay rights group, said Monday that the newlyweds have left Russia, fearing for their security amid official pressure.
A year ago this week, the artist Prince was found dead at Paisley Park, his home, studio, and party space in the Minneapolis suburb of Chaska. Today, a series of search warrants and affidavits from the criminal investigation of Prince's accidental opioid overdose were made public by the Carver County District Court in Minnesota. Dated between April and September 2016, these documents were part of the investigation into how and where Prince obtained a fatal dosage of fentanyl. They also give some insights into the day on which the legendary musician passed away and the circumstances of the weeks leading up to his death on April 21, 2016.
Throughout Prince's residence, including in the laundry room and in Prince's bedroom, investigators discovered controlled substances that "were not contained in typical prescription pill bottles but rather, were stored in various other containers such as vitamin bottles," according to the documents.
Much of the investigation appears to focus on Kirk Johnson, a bodyguard and friend of Prince's since the '80s and, according to the investigators, "one of the few people who had unrestricted access to Paisley Park." The investigation also delved into Dr. Michael Schulenberg, who had begun treating Prince on April 7, 2016 — just weeks before his death. (Prince was said to not have a regular doctor; according to investigators, "his managers would set up for him before a show so that Prince could receive a B12 injection' to 'feel better' before performing for a show.")
Johnson had contacted Schulenberg to help treat Prince's hip pain. One affidavit states that the doctor met with Prince and prescribed him three sedatives: clonidine, hydroxyzine pamoate and diazepam. However, the prescriptions were made in Johnson's name to protect Prince's privacy, Johnson told investigators. A day before Prince's death, on April 20, Johnson picked up the prescriptions under his name; he told county investigators that "this was the first time he had ever done something like that for Prince." Schulenberg was at Paisley Park, dropping off test results, when police arrived there on the morning Prince's body was found.
Schulenberg also told investigators that on April 15, he had prescribed Prince oxycodone, also in Johnson's name. That was the same day that Prince's plane, on a flight to Minnesota following a performance in Atlanta, had made an emergency landing near Chicago. According to The New York Times, Judith Hill and Kirk Johnson were the only other passengers besides Prince on that flight.
Prescription medications written to Johnson and dated April 7, 2016 were found in a suitcase with the name tag of 'Peter Bravestrong,' which singer and friend Judith Hill confirmed to investigators was an alias Prince would use while traveling. The medications included acetaminophen/oxycodone hydrochloride, an opioid painkiller. Investigators also noted that the 'Peter Bravestrong' suitcase contained handwritten lyrics for Prince's song "U Got the Look."
A computer found near that suitcase in Prince's bedroom was initially overlooked by investigators, until they learned through interviews that Prince did not use a cell phone. Instead, the artist communicated only through email and a landline telephone after his cell phone had been hacked and its information leaked.
Jason Kamerud, chief deputy for the Carver County Sheriff's Office, told NPR this afternoon that "no one has been charged, and the investigation is ongoing."
Actor Harrison Ford was involved in an aviation incident at John Wayne Airport in which he flew over a passenger airliner and landed in the wrong location.The actor was cleared to land on a runway at John Wayne and correctly read back the instructions. Instead, his single-engine Aviat Husky landed on a taxiway that sits parallel to the runway and flew above a Boeing 737 on the ground.The American Airlines 737, with 110 passengers and six crew onboard, was bound for Dallas-Ft. Worth as it sat at the intersection of two taxiways. The passenger jet was waiting for Ford's plane to land on the runway in front of them, but instead it flew over them and landed on the taxiway.The FAA says it is investigating the incident.Ford's representatives had no immediate comment.Ford was injured in a small plane crash back in 2015.

The figure skating contingent from Canada, at 17 strong the largest of any nation, intends to lead its country into the Winter Olympics next week in ways both literal and figurative.
The literal: Two-time ice dance medalists Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir, one of the favorites to win gold, will carry the maple leaf flag into Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium for the opening ceremony.
The figurative: With three ice dance couples, three pairs, three women and two men, the Canadians are podium threats in all four disciplines, not to mention heavy favorites in the team event.
"I'm so impressed by the depth of this team," said Isabelle Charest, the Canadian chef de mission and a three-time Olympic medalist in speed skating. "There are so many strong contenders and we have tremendous hope for them heading into the games."
The hope is grounded in some accomplished resumes.
Virtue and Moir, the reigning world champions, are a good place to start. The eight-time national champions were unbeaten all of last season and have put up huge marks to their Rolling Stones-inspired short program and their equally mesmerizing free dance set to music from "Moulin Rouge!"
They'll be joined in the ice dance competition by the teams of Piper Gilles-Paul Poirier and Kaitlyn Weaver-Andrew Poje, the latter two-time world championship medalists.
"We've grown up together," Moir said, "and it's going to be a special moment to take the ice with them and go for gold. We're looking forward to embracing the Olympic spirit."
Two-time world champions Meagan Duhamel and Eric Radford, who took silver at last year's Four Continents on the same Olympic ice, give the Canadians a medal contender in the pairs event. The teams of Julianne Sequin-Charlie Bilodeau and Kirsten Moore-Towers-Michael Marino also will compete.
While all eyes in the women's event will be on Russian stars Evgenia Medvedeva and Alina Zagitova, Canadians Kaetlyn Osmond and Gabrielle Daleman are nearly as formidable. They finished second and third behind Medvedeva at last year's worlds in Finland.
And rising star Larkyn Austman will have her first Olympic experience.
"In 2014, Canada didn't have any medal contenders at the Olympics," Osmond said, "and you almost forget that Gabby and I finished second and third (at worlds) last year. "It's exciting that we're able to send three women to the Olympics, especially because we haven't done it in many years."
Olympic silver medalist Patrick Chan, a three-time world champion and two-time Grand Prix final champ, will be joined by Keegan Messing in a wide-open men's event.
"I feel really good about my confidence for the whole team," Chan said. "After seeing how my teammates have done during the Grand Prix season, talking to Eric and Scott, it's been great. We have really great team energy."
Figure skating historically has been an individual sport, even with the inclusion of a team event at the 2014 Sochi Olympics — where the Canadians finished second to Russia. But there is a strong sense of camaraderie within Team Canada, a close-knit feeling where everyone roots for everyone else.
Even if they happen to be skating against them.
Perhaps their nation's somewhat puzzling Olympic pedigree plays into it. Canada has won 25 medals in figure skating, one behind Russia for second most (the U.S. has 49). But only four of those have been gold, including the pairs medal that Jamie Sale and David Pelletier were forced to share with the Russian team after a scoring controversy at the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics.
Virtue and Moir have two of Canada's three ice dance medals, Barbara Ann Scott won its only ladies gold at the 1948 St. Moritz Games and the men have won five silver and four bronze but no gold.
Chan was the latest, finishing behind Japan's Yuzuru Hanyu in Sochi.
This could be Canada's big chance, though. Its sizeable stable, deep experience and the fact that it has contenders in every event could make "O Canada!" the soundtrack of the Olympics.
It could also make its flag quite popular — especially after Virtue and Moir carry it for the opening ceremony.
"The figure skating team is something else," Virtue said, "but Team Canada across the board is something fierce. It's great to be part of that."
“Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda has launched a project to support hurricane relief for Puerto Rico, including the release of a star-studded new song.
Miranda, a New York native and son of Puerto Rican parents, released “Almost Like Praying” featuring an all-star lineup of artists including Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony, Gloria Estefan and many others.
“Almost Like Praying” will benefit the Hispanic Federation’s UNIDOS Disaster Relief Fund for Puerto Rico. Much of the island remains without power and many continue to struggle with access to food and water weeks after Hurricane Maria made landfall.
Miranda joined “CBS This Morning” to discuss why he decided to write the song, how it all came together and his recent tweets slamming President Trump for the federal response in Puerto Rico.
The award-winning playwright said it was important that the song not only raise awareness, but have a life of its own.
“I also wanted to make it as catchy as any other song I’d write,” he said. “It’s for a good cause but I want it to spread on its own.”
In record time, an Almost Like Praying music video.
Watch, enjoy, and DONATE: https://t.co/RzM7fnYpQq — Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) October 6, 2017
Much of the new track’s lyrics are the names of the 78 towns in Puerto Rico. Miranda said he was inspired by the frantic calls on social media from those on the island who were hoping to hear something about the towns, cut off from communication, where loved ones were.
“What I saw on my Facebook feed — and I’m sure a lot of other Latinos feel the same way — was this roll call of towns. ‘Has anyone heard from Isabela? ‘Has anyone heard from ‘San Juan?’ ‘My grandmother is in Lares,'” Miranda said. “If I can manage to put all 78 towns into a lyric for this song and then use the song for fundraising relief, that’s something we can all get behind.”
PARIS (AP) — It is a dream come true for U.S.-based climate scientists — the offer of all-expenses-paid life in France to advance their research in Europe instead of in the United States under climate skeptic President Donald Trump, two of the winners say.
American scientist Camille Parmesan and British scientist Benjamin Sanderson are among the 18 initial winners, including 13 based in the U.S., who were named recipients of French President Emmanuel Macron's "Make Our Planet Great Again" climate grants.
Macron congratulated the winners during a brief ceremony in Paris on Monday evening, ahead of a climate summit that gathers more than 50 world leaders in the French capital Tuesday.
In an interview with The Associated Press, Parmesan expressed elation at the prospect of spending the next five years doing her research in France instead of the United States.
A scientist from the University of Texas at Austin, she is a leader in the field on how climate affects wildlife. She lived for a few years in the United Kingdom for family reasons and was considering returning to the U.S. until Trump's election.
"He very, very rapidly has been actively trying to erode science in the U.S.A. and in particular climate science," she said. "And it's hard for two reasons: Funding is becoming almost impossible, and in a psychological sense."
Parmesan answered with enthusiasm Macron's appeal for climate researchers to come work in France, minutes after Trump's rejection of the Paris climate accord. "It gave me such a psychological boost, it was so good to have that kind of support, to have the head of state saying I value what you do," she said.
Parmesan, who said she is looking forward to improving her French, will be working at an experimental ecology station in the Pyrenees mountains.
Sanderson, who also worked in the U.S., told the AP that he found it "very reassuring" that France is "openly encouraging climate research."
He said his application was motivated by "the fact that France is making a stand on prioritizing climate change research, but also it's increasingly hard to get research funding in the U.S."
Sanderson used to work at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, on risks and uncertainties under climate change. For the next few years, he will be living in Toulouse, in southern France, where the country's national meteorological service is based.

WASHINGTON (AP) — GOP aide: No lawmakers injured in accident involving train carrying members of Congress to Republican meeting .
MK Yehuda Glick (Likud) announced Monday evening that he will vote with the coalition in favor of the proposed Supermarket Law.
The announcement came after the Minister of Justice, the Minister of Health and the chairman of the coalition agreed that the coalition would adopt a bill that would prohibit advertising and marketing of tobacco products altogether, except in the printed press.
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Country music journalist, publicist and songwriter Hazel Smith has died. She was 83.
Her granddaughter Tara Bruchas said she died at a Nashville hospital on Sunday.
Smith is credited with coining the term "outlaw country" in the 1970s. She worked as a publicist for Kinky Friedman and worked out of Tompall Glaser's studio with artists like Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson. And it was there she came up with the movement's moniker for artists who were bucking Music Row trends.
She wrote a regular popular column for "Country Music" magazine, as well as writing for other outlets, and had songs recorded by Tammy Wynette and Dr. Hook. She also worked with Ricky Skaggs and Sharon White and was the host of a CMT series "Southern Fried Flicks."
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — The Latest on the mock inauguration of Kenya's opposition leader (all times local):
5:05 p.m.
The lawyer for the man who swore in Kenya's opposition leader during a mock inauguration says he has been arrested.
Peter Kaluma says opposition legislator and lawyer T.J. Kajwang has been taken to the Nairobi's criminal investigations department for questioning.
The arrest occurred soon after Interior Minister Fred Matiangi announced that the government had launched investigations into Tuesday's mock inauguration of Raila Odinga as "the people's president."
The minister says the investigations will extend to "conspirators and facilitators."
A government shutdown of the country's top three TV channels continues, and the former Kenyan vice president who had been blocked from being sworn in as Odinga's deputy says his home was attacked overnight in "an assassination attempt."

6:15 a.m.
Former Kenyan Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka says gunshots were fired at his home and a grenade detonated in what was "an assassination attempt."
Musyoka told The Associated Press by phone Wednesday the attack occurred hours after his police security was withdrawn and he had been blocked from attending a mock inauguration of opposition leader Raila Odinga protesting President Uhuru Kenyatta's new term after months of deadly election turmoil.
Musyoka was to take the oath as Odinga's deputy president in the mock inauguration.
The opposition successfully challenged the August election in court, claiming vote-rigging, but boycotted a fresh election in October, claiming a lack of electoral reforms.
Kenya's government cut transmission of three TV channels airing live broadcasts of the Odinga inauguration Tuesday.

LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron has shaken up a two-day visit to Nigeria with a stop at the New Afrika Shrine, a concert hall founded by the late music legend Fela Kuti.
Macron also held talks with Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari on security in Africa's vast Sahel region as the extremist threat grows from groups linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State organization.
Macron's visit to Africa's most populous nation ends Wednesday.
His visit to the New Afrika Shrine was for a launch event for the 2020 Season of African Cultures in France.
Macron also is inaugurating an Alliance Francaise cultural center in Lagos and meeting young Nigerian entrepreneurs.
BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) — Josh McDaniels didn't know what he didn't know.
In 2009, he was the baby-faced 32-year-old prodigy plucked out of Bill Belichick's roost and Tom Brady's shadow to serve as Mike Shanahan's replacement in Denver, holding down two jobs he'd never had: head coach and de facto general manager.
He'd trade away his starting quarterback, draft Tim Tebow and win his first six games, including one against his mentor. But he was fired halfway through his four-year contract, losing 17 of his next 22 games and presiding over his very own videotape scandal.
The Broncos blamed themselves for giving McDaniels too much power with so little experience. Denver then embarked on a renaissance under general manager John Elway and Peyton Manning.
McDaniels spent a year with the Rams before returning for a highly successful second stint with Brady and Belichick, preparing him for his second NFL head coaching gig with the Indianapolis Colts , which will become official after the Super Bowl.
Now 41, McDaniels still doesn't look his age, but he says he is a much wiser than the brash coach who wore the gray hoodie in Denver eight years ago.
McDaniels said he was a much better trainee and tutor in his return to New England, much more appreciative of the breadth of Belichick's artistry and the depth of Brady's genius .
"It's a unique perspective," seeing things a second time after getting a firsthand look behind the coaching curtain, McDaniels said Wednesday, as he helped Brady and Belichick prepare for their eighth Super Bowl.
"Bill does a tremendous job of understanding the pulse of his team. He relates to everyone very well and I've been able to see that and look at that through a different lens. When we need a push, he pushes us. When we need love, he loves us. When we need a pat on the back, he does that. When we need to run hills, we run hills," McDaniels said.
"He just has a tremendous ability to understand when to do what as a head coach. And he serves us in so many ways to make us better coaches, to make the players better players. He's there to help us, he doesn't take it away from us. Believe me, I make tons of mistakes in my role and he's there to help."
McDaniels didn't think it was possible, but he now holds Belichick in even higher regard than he did during his first stint from 2006-08, because he now realizes all the juggling head coaches have to do.
"Before you leave and you do that, it's hard to say that you know what he's going through because you really don't," McDaniels said. "I'm very happy for the experiences that I've gone through. A lot of the failings in my career have been some of the best teachers that I've had. I've really learned a lot from them, I think I'm a better person, a better coach, a better communicator, a lot of things because of the things that I haven't done well."
One thing he's done exceptionally well is working with Brady, who's going for his sixth Super Bowl ring Sunday when the Patriots play the NFC champion Philadelphia Eagles .
McDaniels has long held that working with Brady made him a better coach, because he always had to be prepared to answer the quarterback's incessant questions, to justify the smallest of his decisions, to explain what everyone's role was on every single play.
"We haven't treated each other any differently. He treats me with the respect of a coach and I treat him like I need to make him a better player," McDaniels said. "And I think that's the only way to do it. I know his experience and his understanding is above all others as a player. But I don't really focus a whole lot on that. I focus on the next team, the next week, the next practice, our scheme, what we're trying to do and he's very respectful of that. And we listen and learn from each other.
"We have a tremendous relationship and it's been an honor of my lifetime in coaching to have an opportunity to work with a guy like that as long as I have."

The World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday — World No Tobacco Day — said most countries are failing to significantly reduce tobacco use even though smoking is down across the globe.
"The worldwide prevalence of tobacco smoking has decreased from 27 percent in 2000 to 20 percent in 2016, so progress has been made," said Douglas Bettcher, director of the WHO prevention of non-communicable disease prevention unit.
Since then, the number of adult smokers has remained relatively stable at roughly 1.1 billion due to population growth.
Germany is slightly above average, with 27 percent of adults being smokers in 2015. That figure is down from 30.6 percent in 2000.
Bettcher noted that industrialized countries are making more progress than developing countries due to resistance in the industry and lack of information about the devastating effect of tobacco use.
"One of the major factors impeding low- and middle-income countries certainly is countries face resistance by a tobacco industry who wishes to replace clients who die by freely marketing their products and keeping prices affordable for young people," Bettcher said.

'Governments have the power'
But resistance from the industry isn't the only problem undercutting efforts to curb tobacco use. The WHO said that in China and India, which have the highest number of tobacco users, many people aren't informed of the potentially fatal impact of smoking.
"The percentage of adults who do not believe smoking causes stroke are, for example in China, as high as 73 percent. For heart attacks, 61 percent of adults in China are not aware that smoking increases the risk," Bettcher said. "We aim to close this gap."
China has 307 million smokers, while India comprises 106 million of them. Collectively, they account for nearly 38 percent of the world's smokers, according to WHO figures.
"Governments have the power in their hands to protect their citizens from suffering needlessly from heart disease," added Bettcher.
More than seven million deaths each year have been linked to tobacco use worldwide, with nearly 900,000 of them from inhaling secondhand smoke.

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Europe's top human rights institution is urging Turkey's leaders to "urgently change course" and reverse violations of media freedoms and the rule of law, voicing alarm over democracy in the country.
The call comes as Turkey is set to hold a referendum in April on switching to a presidential system — a move critics fear will concentrate too many powers in the hands of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights, Nils Muiznieks, said in a report released Wednesday that Turkey's already worrisome state of media freedoms and freedom of expression had reached "seriously alarming" levels since a state of emergency was declared following a failed coup attempt.
The commissioner also expressed concerns over the constitutional amendments that will be voted on in the referendum.
NEW YORK (AP) — Guillermo del Toro's 'The Shape of Water' leads Golden Globes nominations with 7 nods .
CHICO, Calif. (AP) — At churches, fairgrounds and other makeshift shelters, thousands of Californians packed what belongings they had into garbage bags and suitcases to return home Tuesday, two days after they were told to flee the threat of massive flooding from a dam's damaged spillway.
They expressed relief as authorities lifted an evacuation order for nearly 200,000 residents who live below the nation's tallest dam. Some voiced frustration at how authorities handled the disaster that never happened. Most were just happy to be heading home.
"You don't appreciate home until it's taken away from you," said Oroville resident Margaret Johnston, 69, one of hundreds who had sought shelter at the Neighborhood Church of Chico, northwest of her town.
Johnston and others huddled around televisions to watch a live broadcast where Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said the risk of the spillway collapsing was significantly reduced. But he said the region would remain under an evacuation warning, meaning residents needed to be ready to flee again if conditions worsen.
"It was just frustrating. Very frustrating," Johnston said about the back-and-forth from officials and the mad rush to get out of Oroville after the evacuation order Sunday.
She fled with her two sons, packing a few blankets, pillows and clothes into a black garbage bag.
"It feels great to be going home," Johnston said.
State water officials said they had drained enough of the lake behind Oroville Dam so that its earthen emergency spillway will not be needed to handle runoff from an approaching storm.
"It's great, all of us can finally go home," said Pedro Mota of Gridley, who has been staying at a Red Cross shelter at a fairground in Chico with his wife and four young children. He wasn't concerned by the on-again, off-again evacuation.
"They're doing their job. They're going to know more than me," he said by telephone. "I'm just going to listen to them and follow their advice on it."
Mota said he would be prepared if the sirens sound again.
"I'm still going to play it by ear, head back home but still have things packed and ready to go just in case they make it mandatory," he said.
Rod Remocal and his wife, Kelly, were taking the same cautious approach.
"This time we're going to be on call like they said," said Remocal, who lives in Biggs, west of Oroville.
When the couple left in a rush Sunday night, they grabbed their four dogs, blankets and a few important papers as sirens sounded and a fire truck's loud speaker told them to flee immediately.
"We're all coming back and pack and be ready this time," he said by telephone after leaving the Red Cross shelter earlier in the day.
On his drive back, Remocal noticed law enforcement stationed at every major intersection as officers prepared to guide the expected parade of vehicles back home. He said traffic was flowing smoothly, in sharp contrast with the chaotic mass flight of thousands of vehicles two days earlier.
He praised the Red Cross and other emergency workers and said he was happy when the evacuation order ended.
"It just took a big load off me, man, just the thrill of relief," he said.

PLANT CITY, Fla. (AP) — A Florida teen who doctors say is dying from a rare form of cancer has been granted one of his final wishes, to be married to his high school sweetheart.
The Tampa Bay Times reports 19-year-old Dustin Snyder and 21-year-old Sierra Siverio were wed Sunday in Plant City, near Tampa.
"After her being there with me through this cancer, always supporting me and loving me, that's when I knew she was the one," Snyder said. "I wanted to give her something back before my time was up."
Doctors say Snyder has weeks or maybe a month to live. Wasting no time, Snyder proposed to Siverio on Thursday. The newspaper reports the community quickly came together to make sure the wedding took place, donating everything from the rings to the wedding gown and the venue.
The two say they've been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from strangers.
Snyder's sister, Brittany Hails, posted her brother's story on Facebook and started a GoFundMe page, which had raised nearly $13,000 by Friday. An update said they had met their goal and leftover donations would help the family with other expenses.
"I didn't think it would go this far, but God was on our side," Hails said. "Dustin's really excited, and all we wanted is for him to be happy. And he's happy right now."
The teens met in middle school, but had lost touch before reuniting in high school. Snyder has battled synovial sarcoma much of that time.
On June 27, 2016, the day before his 18th birthday, Snyder went to the hospital with chest pains, which his mother thought were brought on by asthma. But doctors quickly diagnosed the teen with synovial sarcoma, which targets soft tissue and is more common among adolescents and young adults than other age groups who contract it.
"When I first found out I was devastated, but then he told me I needed to be strong for him," Siverio said. "Ever since he said that I've been by his side."

DALLAS (AP) — Allison Preiss became a hero to airline passengers this spring when she scored a $10,000 travel voucher for losing her seat on an oversold flight.
Negotiating skill mixed with a bit of luck helped Preiss land the elusive payoff.
With the peak summer travel season right around the corner, other passengers can learn from Preiss's example if they wind up on an overcrowded flight.
There are two situations that passengers might find themselves in, and their rights — and bargaining power — vary greatly between them.
In the first, an airline forces a passenger off a flight for lack of space — called bumping. Under federal rules, the passenger is entitled to cash compensation, not just a voucher, and a seat on a later flight. Bumped passengers whose travel is delayed for at least an hour are entitled to up to $1,350 in compensation, with the amount based on the length of the delay and the one-way price of the ticket.
"The vast majority of Americans take one airline trip a year, and since vouchers are usually valid for just one year, most people should ask for cash," said George Hobica, a travel expert who founded the airfarewatchdog.com website. But, he added, frequent fliers might want to negotiate to see how high the airline will go with a voucher.
That's what Preiss did back in March. Thanks to a broken seat, United bumped her from a flight from Dulles Airport outside Washington to Austin, Texas. But Preiss had leverage because United couldn't find anyone willing to give up their seat. She calculated that she was entitled to about $650 in cash based on the price of her ticket, and she turned down a $2,000 voucher. Then a second United employee said she could offer a voucher up to $10,000 plus a seat on a later flight, and Preiss took it.
The second situation occurs when the airline hasn't yet kicked anyone off an overbooked flight but instead looks for people to take a later flight in exchange for compensation — usually a voucher; the airline is not legally required to pay cash to volunteers.
When airlines know a flight is overbooked, they will make lowball offers to customers at ticket counters, kiosks and gate areas. They will raise the amount of the vouchers until they find a taker, pitting passengers against each other in a kind of reverse auction.
"My advice would be to start high," said Brian Kelly, CEO of travel website The Points Guy. "If you're going to be displaced for several hours, don't take the quick and easy $200 (voucher)."
Kelly said a $400 voucher for getting off a domestic flight or $800 for an international one would be "a solid starting point."
Travel experts suspect that airlines prefer vouchers partly because a high percentage of them never get used. The airlines do not disclose redemption rates.
Airlines have gotten very good at buying off passengers on overbooked flights. Last year, about 23,000 passengers were forcibly bumped — the lowest rate since the federal government started keeping track in 1995 — while nearly 342,000 people took an airline's offer and gave up their seat.
You might wonder how airlines ever come up short on seats.
Airlines can legally oversell flights — although some, like JetBlue, say they don't — on the assumption that some people won't show up. Overbooking can also occur when bad weather or a mechanical breakdown causes flights to be canceled, forcing the airline to scramble to accommodate stranded passengers.
Sometimes airlines switch a flight to a smaller plane with fewer seats. Occasionally, they need to make room for an air marshal or employees. And airlines may cancel flights or limit seating on smaller planes in hot weather because the thinner air makes it harder to generate enough lift for takeoff.
If you take a voucher for getting off a flight, there are some rules you should know. For instance, most airlines won't replace lost vouchers, and they can't be sold, although Delta allows them to be transferred to someone flying on the same reservation as the person who got the voucher.
On Southwest, vouchers can only be applied to airfare while American also lets them cover taxes and fees and Delta vouchers can be applied to government taxes. But you can't use vouchers to purchase extra legroom or an in-flight meal.
If your airline looks for volunteers to get off an overcrowded flight, experts offer this advice before accepting a voucher:
— Insist on a confirmed seat, not standby, on the next available flight in addition to the voucher for future travel.
— If you will be stuck for an extended time, ask for meal or hotel vouchers too.
— Ask when the travel voucher expires — typically they are good for one year — and whether it can be combined with other discounts.
— Find out if the voucher can be used on other airlines; American and Delta vouchers can be used on some partner airlines, United and Southwest certificates cannot.
Kelly, the travel-points expert, advises that no matter what, "don't get stressed."
"Look at it as an opportunity for a nice little payday."

In the Alabama Republican Senate race, every candidate wants to be just like Donald Trump.
But in Tuesday's primary, the leading candidate sounds and acts more like the president, while it's the incumbent, an appointed senator just fighting to make it into a likely runoff, who has Trump's actual blessing — but also the curse of being Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's favorite candidate.
That's the conundrum of the Republican contest, largely seen as a three-way race between front-runner Roy Moore, a controversial former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice; Sen. Luther Strange, appointed back in February to fill the seat of now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions; and Rep. Mo Brooks, who's seized on an anti-McConnell platform as the president's attacks against the Senate's top Republican have intensified recently.
Moore has consistently polled atop the field, and looks likely to claim a spot in a probable September runoff. His ads sound downright Trumpian, promising to "drain the swamp" and taking a swipe at D.C. elites.
Moore is well-known throughout the state — and the country — too. He first gained national notoriety when he refused to remove a monument of the Ten Commandments from a state judicial building despite a federal court order; Moore himself was then removed from his position as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court in 2003. He won election to the same post again in 2012, but was then suspended after he ordered judges to enforce the state's ban on same-sex marriage despite the Supreme Court's 2015 decision in favor of gay marriage nationwide under the federal Constitution. He resigned earlier this year to challenge Strange.
To state observers, it's not surprising that Moore has been able to build a strong following and even expand beyond what might be his typical conservative base in the state.
"Alabama voters supported Trump because he spoke his mind and said all the things they had been thinking about government," said Brent Buchanan, a GOP strategist and pollster in the state. "Out of all the candidates, Roy Moore has some of those similar characteristics. You may not agree with all of his policy or personal preferences, but you know that Roy Moore is going to do what Roy Moore believes."
That's why it was so, well, strange last week when Trump tweeted out his support for Strange, saying the incumbent has his "complete and total endorsement!"
The senator has benefited from millions of dollars in ads from the McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund super PAC. The very next day after endorsing Strange, Trump started going on Twitter tirades against the GOP Senate leader for failing to pass a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.
Strange has tried to prove his loyalty to the president ever since he was appointed under less than auspicious circumstances. As Alabama's attorney general, Strange was investigating then-Gov. Robert Bentley for misuse of his office amid a sex scandal when Bentley chose Strange to replace Sessions. Facing impeachment, Bentley eventually resigned, and the new governor, Kay Ivey, moved up the date for the special election to replace Sessions long-term.
Polling done in the wake of Trump's surprise endorsement showed that the president's blessing had done little — yet — to move the needle toward Strange. One by cygnal, Buchanan's firm, conducted partly after the endorsement, showed Moore still with a lead and high favorables, Strange remained static and it was Brooks who took a hit.
Buchanan said the Trump endorsement could help Strange turn out some who were less likely to vote on Tuesday, which could be key in what's already expected to be a very low-turnout affair.
And the pro-Trump America First Action super PAC also announced late Friday it would be spending up to $200,000 on digital ads targeting Trump voters to encourage them to come out for Strange.
However, although he's slipping in polling, Brooks is hoping to turn McConnell's fervent support for Strange into a last-ditch way to get into the likely runoff against Moore. He's hitched a "Ditch Mitch" banner to his campaign bus in the final days, and in his closing ad he echoes Trump's frustration with McConnell's inability to push through an Obamacare repeal.
"McConnell and Strange are weak, but together we can be strong," Brooks says. "Mr. President, isn't it time we tell McConnell and Strange, 'You're fired?'"
Ultimately, the Huntsville-area congressman hasn't had the resources the other two candidates have had, and he hasn't been elected statewide before like Moore and Strange. And, perhaps most damaging, he was certainly no fan of Trump during the GOP presidential primaries last year, during which he supported Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. McConnell's super PAC has pointed that out in ads, saying Brooks sided with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.
If Strange does fall short of the runoff, University of Alabama political science professor emeritus William Stewart, a longtime political observer in the state, said that's a big problem for McConnell. And, if Strange does make it to the likely September runoff, expect that to be a big point Moore can use against Strange, too.
"The McConnell support for Strange will not be helpful because McConnell, as the president says, hasn't been successful at pushing through the president's agenda, " Stewart said. "If Strange doesn't make the runoff, that's a definite blow to McConnell," more so than Trump.
Polling shows Moore is still the favorite against Strange in a runoff, and that's where the McConnell ties could be the most deadly — and place the president in a more precarious spot given his surprising endorsement. Stewart said it would be interesting to watch how much Trump puts his muscle behind Strange later, and something like traveling to Alabama — one of Trump's best states in 2016 — for a rally on the senator's behalf would certainly give Strange a boost.
No matter who wins the GOP nomination though, they'll be the heavy favorite in the December general election, even if it's the more controversial Moore. Democrats are expected to nominate Doug Jones, a former U.S. attorney, though he could face a runoff against the aptly-named Robert Kennedy Jr., a Naval veteran who is not related to the famous Democratic political family.
If Moore is the GOP nominee, it will be interesting to watch whether the Democrats can make it even a mildly competitive contest — something Stewart, the former University of Alabama professor, said is doubtful, and is emblematic of the problems the party faces overall in the South.
"Right now the Democratic Party is very impotent here," Stewart said. "I think whomever the Republicans choose as their nominee will be the winner."
In the pilot episode of Facebook Watch’s “Ball in the Family,” LaVar Ball laid out his “master plan” to get all three of his sons—Lonzo Ball, LiAngelo Ball and LaMelo Ball—onto the Los Angeles Lakers.
The Big Baller Brand CEO is already a third of the way there, with Zo enduring his ups and downs as an NBA rookie in Purple and Gold. But with Gelo withdrawing from UCLA, and Melo abandoning his NCAA future to pursue his professional options overseas, LaVar’s blueprint for the Lakers has taken a turn—maybe, just maybe, toward the more likely.
Even before he got caught shoplifting in China, Gelo’s odds of getting plucked out of the NBA draft were slim. Most scouts hardly pegged the 6-foot-5, 216-pound wing-forward as a high-major college prospect coming in, much less a potential top-60 pick following his freshman year.
Either way, LiAngelo’s journey to join Lonzo in the Association was going to wind its way through the NBA Las Vegas Summer League and into training camp, with no guarantee of a roster spot as an undrafted free agent. Now that he’s no longer spending time posing as a student at UCLA, Gelo can devote more of his time and energy to working on his game ahead of his NBA eligibility.
The bigger pawn in LaVar’s plan, though, is LaMelo.
While LiAngelo’s draft prospects were always slim, Melo had a shot to get selected relatively early in the 2020 draft had he gone to college, and might still get long looks from NBA teams assuming he spends a couple seasons overseas.
Recent photos show that LaMelo is much closer to LiAngelo and Lonzo’s height now than he was as a sophomore at Chino Hills High School—assuming he hasn’t surpassed his older brothers in that capacity.

You'll be waking up a little more awesome tomorrow. Whoa! Something went wrong. Try again?
BBB thanks NYPD for keeping everybody safe at our Pop Up Shop today. New Yorks Finest! A post shared by LaMelo Ball (@melo) on Dec 10, 2017 at 7:55pm PST
At 16, he might still have room to grow. And even if Melo doesn’t sprout further, he figures to fill out his lanky frame in the coming years.
That’s a problem for any opponents who may have to deal with him abroad—and an enticement for any NBA team that’s keen to track him wherever he goes. It’s possible that he’s already the best scorer and ball handler among his brothers, with the deepest shooting range of the three, despite an unorthodox form that evokes visions of Reggie Miller.
It’s no wonder, then, that LaVar has said he thinks Melo will be the best of the bunch.
If the Lakers duly improve over the course of Lonzo’s rookie contract, and LaMelo were to blossom as a Bruin, the Purple and Gold probably wouldn’t land a pick within range of drafting the youngest Ball boy come June 2020.
But tuck Melo into a lower-division league in some far-flung corner of the basketball world, away from most of the NBA’s prying eyes, and he just might land in the Lakers’ lap, either as a second-round pick or an undrafted free agent like Gelo could be.
There’s no need to read tea leaves to see the outlines of this approach. In fact, LaVar spelled it all out with ESPN’s Jeff Goodman this past June.
“Gelo [LiAngelo] is going [to] be one-and-done whether he’s good or bad,” LaVar said. “I’m going to put him in the draft, hope they don’t take him. Bring him into the Lakers as a free agent, let him wind up with his brother and watch how good they play together.”
“I’m going to do the same thing with Melo,” he added. “And we get three of the Ball boys on the Lakers together, and we gonna go championship, championship, championship, championship, championship. You think I’m playing? You saw what they did in high school.”
Guiding Gelo and Melo into the Lakers’ range is one thing. Convincing them to spend precious resources on Zo’s brothers is quite another.
Will the team want to deepen its ties to LaVar, especially in light of his ongoing war of words with head coach Luke Walton? Will blood relations be reason enough for L.A. to give Gelo and Melo a shot each?
It wouldn’t be the first time an NBA team extended opportunities to the less-talented siblings of an incumbent star. The Golden State Warriors taken extended looks at Seth Curry (Stephen Curry’s younger brother) and Mychel Thompson (Klay Thompson’s older brother). The New York Knicks took a similar tack with Chris Smith (J.R. Smith’s younger brother).
In all three cases, the bulk (if not the entirety) of the playing time afforded to the other brothers came in the D-League, now known as the G-League. If LiAngelo and LaMelo do latch on with the Lakers, they may have to start with the team’s South Bay affiliate, which plays its home games at the team’s practice facility (the UCLA Health Training Center) in El Segundo.
That wouldn’t be a bad path for either of Lonzo’s brothers to tread. The South Bay Lakers have already had three of their players (Alex Caruso, Thomas Bryant, Vander Blue) recalled by the big club. Rookie Josh Hart has also played two games in the G-League between his stints with the Lakers.
There’s no guarantee that Gelo or Melo will so much as sniff the NBA’s minor league. As much as it has become fertile ground for player development, it’s still a highly competitive enterprise replete with grown men, many of whom have either NBA experience or the talent to gain some in the weeks, months and years to come.
It’s still too early to say that LiAngelo and LaMelo have that in them. But LaVar’s decisions to redirect their respective basketball journeys could, in some respects, put them closer to wearing Purple and Gold than playing in college would have.
MIAMI (AP) — Marcell Ozuna homered to start the Miami Marlins' comeback from an early four-run deficit, and they beat the Oakland Athletics 11-6 Wednesday to complete a two-game sweep.
Ozuna hit his 17th home run to start the second inning, added a double and had three RBIs. Tyler Moore hit his fifth homer and scored three times to help the Marlins overcome a wobbly outing by Edinson Volquez, who had a no-hitter in his most recent home start.
Ichiro Suzuki had a pinch-hit single in the fifth for his 365th interleague hit, breaking Derek Jeter's major league record.
Ryon Healy hit a three-run homer for the Athletics (27-38), who fell to 11 games below .500 for the first time. They went 1-5 on their trip and lost their ninth consecutive road series, their longest such streak since 1986.
Oakland lost after leading by three or more runs three times on the trip. Daniel Gossett (0-1) couldn't hold a 4-0 lead in his major league debut after being called up from Triple-A Nashville, and allowed seven runs, six earned, in 3 1-3 innings.
Volquez lasted only four innings and gave up four hits, four walks and five runs, four earned.
Kyle Barraclough (2-1), the first of six Miami relievers, pitched a scoreless fifth.
PITCHER HITTING
Gossett reached in the fourth on an infield single, his first major league hit and the first by Athletics pitchers in their past 27 at-bats over two seasons. He then scored on Jed Lowrie's double to put Oakland ahead 5-4.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Oakland: RF Matt Joyce left in the third, one inning after he cut his chin colliding with first baseman Yonder Alonso pursuing a popup, which Alonso caught.
Miami: LHP Braxton Garrett, the Marlins' top prospect, will receive a second opinion on his sore left elbow next week from specialist Dr. James Andrews. Garrett has been diagnosed with a partial tear of the ulnar collateral ligament and could require Tommy John surgery.
ROSTER MOVE
To make room on the roster for Gossett, 1B-OF Matt Olson was optioned to Nashville.
DRAFT PICK
The Marlins took the brother of Chicago Bears tight end Dion Sims in the 14th round of the draft. Demetrius Sims is a shortstop at Bethune-Cookman.
UP NEXT
Miami: The Marlins hit the road after winning for the 10th time in their past 12 home games. They begin a three-game series at Atlanta on Friday, when RHP Dan Straily (4-4, 3.89) will pitch against LHP Sean Newcomb (0-1, 0.00).
Oakland: The A's return home for a four-game series against the Yankees beginning Thursday, when RHP Sonny Gray (2-2, 4.37) will face LHP Jordan Montgomery (4-4, 3.55).

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Public criticism of the German auto industry has escalated after a report that an industry-sponsored entity commissioned a study of the effects of diesel exhaust using monkeys, while another study exposed humans to low levels of one type of air pollutant.
The German government on Monday condemned the experiments and Volkswagen sought to distance itself from them, with its chairman saying that "in the name of the whole board I emphatically disavow such practices."
The tests were reportedly commissioned by a research group funded by major German auto companies.
Revelations of the tests add a twist to the German auto industry's attempt to move past Volkswagen's scandal over cheating on diesel tests and the resulting questioning of diesel technology across the industry.
Volkswagen Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch said the tests must be "investigated completely and without reservation," the dpa news agency reported.
A report by The New York Times found that the research group financed by top German car manufacturers commissioned experiments in which one group of monkeys was exposed to diesel exhaust from a late-model Volkswagen, while another group was exposed to fumes from an older Ford pickup.
The experiments were carried out in 2014 before Volkswagen was caught using software that let vehicles cheat on emissions tests. They were intended to show modern diesel technology had solved the problem of excess emissions, but according to the Times report the Volkswagen car in the tests was equipped with illegal software that turned emissions controls on while the car was on test stands and off during regular driving.
Volkswagen admitted using the software in 2015. The Volkswagen scandal led to public scrutiny of diesel emissions as regulators discovered that other companies' vehicles also had higher emissions on the road than during testing, though not necessarily through illegal rigging. The industry has had to fend off calls for diesel bans in German cities with high pollution levels.
Daimler AG said it was "appalled by the nature and extent of the studies" and said that, though it didn't have any influence on the studies' design, "we have launched a comprehensive investigation into the matter."
BMW said that it "did not participate in the mentioned study" on animals "and distances itself from this study." It said it was investigating the work and background of the research group.
The Times report said the group that commissioned the studies, known by German initial EUGT, got all of its funding from the three automakers.
The Times report was followed by one in Monday's edition of the Stuttgarter Zeitung daily that the now-closed research group also commissioned tests in which humans were exposed to nitrogen dioxide, which belongs to a class of pollutants known as nitrogen oxides. The group reportedly said the tests showed no effect on the subjects.
The human study, carried out by Aachen University, involved studying the effects of exposing 25 subjects, mostly students, to low levels of nitrogen dioxide like those that could be found in the environment — from a 40-liter bottle, not a diesel engine. The individuals gave informed written consent for the study, which was approved by the ethics committee of the university's medical faculty, according to the study. The university said the study had no relation to the diesel scandal.
The German government condemned the reported tests on animals and humans. Transport Minister Christian Schmidt "has no understanding for such tests ... that do not serve science but merely PR aims," spokesman Ingo Strater told reporters in Berlin.
He called for the companies concerned to provide "immediate and detailed" responses, and said a ministry commission of inquiry that was set up after the emissions scandal broke will hold a special meeting to examine whether there are any other cases.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said that "the disgust many people are feeling is absolutely understandable."
"These tests on monkeys or even humans can in no way be ethically justified," Seibert said. "They raise many critical questions for those behind these tests, and these questions must urgently be answered."
He questioned the aims of the tests. "The automakers have to reduce emissions of harmful substances further and further," he said. "They should not be trying to prove the supposed harmlessness of exhaust with the help of monkeys or even humans."
Seibert said that the supervisory boards of the companies concerned "have a particular responsibility."
The governor of the German state of Lower Saxony, a major shareholder in Volkswagen, added his voice to calls for quick answers.
Stephan Weil, who sits on VW's supervisory board, stressed that "the behavior of the company must in every respect fulfill ethical demands." He said he hadn't known about the tests.

This story has been corrected to show that a research group commissioned the tests, not that it carried them out. A previous version corrected the first paragraph to show that the second set of tests on humans didn't involve diesel exhaust.
TAIPEI (Taiwan News) – Taipei is the 21st best university city in the world, while Hsinchu City is ranked No.75, according to rankings published by British higher education information service QS Quacquarelli Symonds.
On a separate list based on the evaluation by 18,000 students and graduates only, Taipei City rated as No.10, reports said Wednesday.
The study considered several factors, including safety, pollution, cost of living, college fees, and attractiveness to students in general. For the first time in the survey’s five-year history, students were also asked to help out with the rating, reports said.
Only cities with a population of more than 250,000 and with at least two universities which featured in the company’s recent lists were eligible.
After having led the list for four consecutive years, Paris was pushed aside by Montreal, Canada. London was No.3, with the South Korean capital Seoul the best Asian university city at No.4. Tokyo was the only other Asian city in the top-ten, at No.7.
Four Chinese cities were listed, Shanghai at No.25, Beijing at No.30, Nanjing at No.80, and Wuhan as the lowest on this year’s list, at No.100.
On the rankings selected by the students, the Canadian capital Ottawa came out first, Shanghai was No.3, Seoul No.8 and the Kansai area of Japan No.9 just ahead of Taipei.
Positive factors for the Taiwanese capital included the relatively low cost of living and studying, convenient public transportation, and a healthy mix of tradition and modernity, QS said.
Hsinchu might be more relaxed, but it also offered interesting museums and Taiwan’s version of Silicon Valley nearby, according to the ratings group.

Former Australian PM Tony Abbott said that if US President-elect Donald Trump holds by his promise to move the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, then Australia should take a similar step.
Abbott has called on Australia to cut its $40 million-a-year aid budget to the Palestinian Authority while it “keeps paying pensions to terrorists and their families”, according to The Australian.
Facebook stock took a plunge Monday. It was its worst loss in four years. The drop is a result of concerns that a data mining firm that worked for the Trump campaign improperly obtained data from tens of millions of Facebook users. That company is now banned from using Facebook.Jessica Iriarte guesses she checks her Facebook account at least 10 times a day and admits sometimes she takes those personality quizzes."I don't know who is collecting all that information, it's kinda fun and I don't know what they're doing with the information," said Iriarte.In some cases, it's more than you think. University of Cambridge Psychology Professor Aleksandr Kogan received permission from Facebook to use his personality quiz app. It collected information about profiles, likes, and users' friends. Facebook claims the professor broke the rules and gave the data to Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting company hired by the Trump campaign. All that data was extremely valuable."It will give me an indication on your political views, information about your financial status all of these things. They took these things and created a psychological profile," explained Ahmed Banafa, a cyber-security expert and professor at San Jose State University's School of Engineering.Roughly 50 million Facebook profiles were affected. Facebook admits it knew about the violation in 2015, but did not disclose it publicly. Facebook demanded Cambridge Analytica destroy all the data. The firm claims it did. In a statement, Facebook says "We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. We remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information." Complete statement is hereFacebook has banned Cambridge Analytica from using its platform and has hired a forensics firm to complete an audit. Cyber security experts warn users to think twice when using third party apps on Facebook. Click here to read the statement from Facebook."There will be some kind of steps to be taken from Facebook or by the regulators to stop something like this. You cannot share the information of people without their own permission. That will be the silver lining in this whole process," said Banafa.That's the hope that many Facebook users have.
MONTREAL (AP) — U.S. Trade Rep. Robert Lighthizer said Monday talks to rewrite the North American Free Trade Agreement are progressing very slowly.
Lighthizer said the U.S. views NAFTA as a "very important agreement" and said the sixth round of talks between Canada, the United States and Mexico, which concluded Monday, were a "step forward."
"Some real headway was made here," Lighthizer said. "We're committed to moving forward.'
President Donald Trump called NAFTA a job-killing "disaster" on the campaign trail and has threatened to withdraw from the 24-year-old pact if he can't get what he wants.
Lighthizer said there will be another round in Mexico in late February and said core issues are starting to be discussed.
The negotiators had originally hoped to reach an agreement before Mexico's July presidential election and U.S. midterms turn up the political pressure.
One of the main sticking points in the latest rounds of negotiations has been the Trump administration's position on rules of origin for auto parts. The US is calling for any new agreement to include a proviso stipulating that North American-made car parts must constitute 85 percent of new vehicles in order to avoid tariffs, with 50 percent originating in the United States.
Canada's proposal would take elements such as research and development and intellectual property into account in those calculations. Lighthizer, however, called the idea "vague."
"We find that the automobile rules of origin idea that was presented, when analyzed, may lead to less regional content than we have now, fewer jobs in the United States, Canada and likely Mexico," he said. "So this is the opposite of what we are trying to do."
Still, Lighthizer said the fact that Canada is willing to discuss core issues like auto parts is encouraging.
"Now they're starting to realize that we have to begin to talk. And that's a reason for guarded optimism," he said.
Lighthizer said the Trump administration's goal coming out of the negotiations is to boost the number of manufacturing jobs in the United States, either by encouraging new investment or by bringing back jobs that had moved to Mexico.
TAIPEI (Taiwan News) – Talk show host Wang Ben-hu was in critical condition at the National Cheng Kung University Hospital in Tainan Wednesday, with reports saying a priest had been called in to pray with him.
Earlier in the day, hospital officials rejected media reports that the veteran supporter of Taiwan independence had already passed away.
Last month, reports emerged that Wang, 63, suffered from a rare disease which needed a bone marrow transplantation to cure. He was taken to hospital where his situation apparently deteriorated, but out of respect for his and his family’s privacy, the institution refused to comment on the precise details of his condition.
A news team visited Wang’s church Wednesday morning and was reportedly told the local priest and other members of the congregation had visited him in hospital to pray and sing hymns.
His current disease was reportedly not related to a cancer from which he recovered in 2013.
WASHINGTON (AP) — With a new health secretary in office, the Trump administration is proposing its first regulatory changes to the health insurance markets created by President Barack Obama's overhaul.
Among the most noticeable change for consumers: a shorter sign-up window of 45 days, as opposed to three months.
Administration officials said Wednesday the new regulations will help to stabilize the individual insurance market for next year. That could buy time for the Republican-led Congress to make good on its promise to repeal the Obama-era health care overhaul and replace it with a conservative approach.
Many of the proposed changes reflect the wishes of the insurance industry. Even so, insurer Humana announced Tuesday it will not participate in next year in the government-run marketplaces.
Human Services Secretary Tom Price was confirmed Friday.

Mayweather, who retired in September 2015 after winning all 49 of his pro fights, will face a mixed martial arts fighter who has never been in a scheduled 12-round fight at the MGM Grand arena. The fight will take place in a boxing ring and be governed by boxing rules. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File)
LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The real fun will come before the fight, and what a spectacle it should be. Put Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Conor McGregor on a stage together to promote their fight and anything can happen.
Put them together in a ring, though, and it's an absolute mismatch.
That's the first thing to consider when all the talk begins about what a devastating puncher McGregor is. The first thing to think about when it's suggested that Mayweather may have lost some of his skills after two years of traveling the world in his private jet.
If you thought you were snookered out of $100 when Mayweather fought a snoozer against Manny Pacquiao, you might keep a firm hand on your wallet. The greatest defensive fighter of his time against a guy who has never thrown a punch in a pro boxing match?
Let the yawning begin.
This could be 12 rounds of tedium on Aug. 26 in Las Vegas that makes Mayweather-Pacquiao look like Hagler-Hearns in comparison. It might be some kind of bizarre disqualification when McGregor finds out Mayweather doesn't stick his chin out to be hit the way some UFC fighters do or really does try to kick Mayweather when he's down.
What it won't be is any kind of legitimate fight, no matter how much rabid UFC fans want desperately to believe it will be.
That's no knock on McGregor, who is a ferocious puncher in the octagon with a personality to match his power. Indeed, he would likely be heavily favored over Mayweather had the two decided to do the fight under UFC rules.
One of the great trash talkers, too, who was just warming up on Wednesday when he told UFC chief Dana White what his intentions are.
''Conor told me this morning the McGregor clan has been taking over villages for 300 years,'' White said, ''and that Floyd's village is next.''
Good stuff, and there's lots more to come. McGregor can turn a phrase as well as he can throw a punch or a water bottle at an opponent.
If this was a reality show it would be a hit in the ratings. Just imagine the scene when McGregor rolls into Mayweather's new strip club in Las Vegas and mimics his propensity for throwing cash around.
But this is a boxing match, and Mayweather is a masterful boxer. He was throwing punches before he could walk, and if he had elected to stay in retirement he'd still be considered one of the top 10 fighters ever.
Two years out of the ring won't change that. Age won't be a factor, either, and Mayweather has never let himself get out of shape.
Oddsmakers in this gambling city understand that, setting the initial line at a whopping 11-1 in Mayweather's favor. It would be even higher than that, but UFC fans will be lining up with $20 bills in hand to bet their man as an underdog.
''Realistically if we were just putting up a number and didn't have to take bets on it, Floyd would be 100-1,'' said Nick Bogdanovich, oddsmaker for the William Hill chain.
Mayweather was out on a run in Los Angeles when the fight was announced, training intensely already like he always does. Someone else will have to watch over the strip club for a few months while he focuses on the task at hand.
There's huge money at stake, even for a fighter who made more than $200 million for beating Pacquiao. No one is making predictions, but it's likely the hybrid fight will at least end up in second place in pay-per-view sales behind the $400 million or so brought in by the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight.
Balance that against the chance McGregor may ruin his brand - and that of the UFC - by being embarrassed by Mayweather in the ring, and the money wins out.
Even White, who was initially skeptical about putting his star in a boxing match, seems ready now to push the idea that he could actually win.
''I've stopped doubting this kid a long time ago,'' White said. ''The reason he's such a superstar is this guy will fight anyone, anywhere, at any time.''
Give McGregor credit for doing that, but give him even more credit for what turned out to be a masterful plan to make the fight happen. It was two years ago that he first suggested he could beat Mayweather in a boxing ring, and he's trolled Mayweather ever since, jabbing at every opening until he finally got him to sign on the dotted line.
Sure, it's a freak show of sorts, bordering on something you see in WWE. But both fighters know their roles, and they will play them well.
So enjoy the ride, because it should be a wild one.
Just understand that the fun almost surely ends when the opening bell rings.

Idara Inokon, Miss Nigeria USA contestant representing Akwa Ibom, has emerged winner of Miss
Nigeria USA 2017 beauty pageant held on Saturday night into early Sunday morning in New York.
Idara, who was crowned by the outgone holder of the title, Lola Adeoye, beat 13 other contestants to emerge winner.
The new Miss Nigeria USA, who was the fourth to be crowned in the pageant, would cart home $10,000 in prizes, according to Joy Fakhoury, the organiser of the annual beauty pageant.
She would also embark on a pet project that would impact on the less privileged back home in Nigeria.
Each of the contestants represented her culture in the pageant that was meant to promote the richness of Nigerian culture, the diversity of its people, the beauty and intellect of the Nigerian lady and to promote togetherness and unity among Nigerians in the Diaspora.
Miss Ondo – Ayoyemi Ajimatanrareje, emerged the First Runner-up, Miss Lagos – Susan Adeyemi, emerged the Second Runner-up, while Miss Rivers, Lucy Edosomwan, emerged Miss Congeniality, in the keenly contested pageant.
The contestants were tested in intelligence, carriage, beauty, knowledge about Nigeria, Nigerian culture, and planned contributions to Nigeria through a pet project during their reign.
Judges said that they had a hard time determining the winners as all the contestants performed outstandingly. Fourteen contestants made the finals on Saturday. They were; Miss Abia, Anambra, Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Delta, Ebonyi, Edo, Ekiti, Enugu, Imo, Lagos, Ogun, Ondo and Rivers States.
The new Miss Nigeria USA, while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria after her crowning, expressed surprise at her emergence, pledging to devote her reign to impacting the lives of the less privileged in Nigeria. “I was very surprised, I felt very shaky in the whole competition, you know how nerves get to you but I just said ‘Idara, whatever the outcome, you did your best and so I went out with a smile’.
“I wanted to compete in a different pageant in New York back in April but it happened to be the same weekend as one of my close friend’s. “And so, I said well, let me reconsider and find a pageant here in the U.S. that has good values and is something I want to stand behind. “So, when I found Miss Nigeria USA and I found that the pageant was located in New York, I was extremely excited.
“I see it as a moment to share women empowerment and to represent my culture, which is a perfect opportunity. I really want to start to get to work to see how I can serve my community. “My platform is to create awareness on prevention. As a registered nurse, I do health education on a daily basis. “It is something I am very passionate about and I believe that if people are educated about their health, they can live healthier lives. So that would be what I would pursue during my reign,” she said.
Inokon, a registered nurse in the U.S., and born to a Nigerian father from Akwa Ibom, graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park in 2010 with a Bachelor of Science and Psychology.
She also attended the Accelerated Nursing Programme at the University of Delaware and graduated in 2014, and currently a Masters Student in Family Nursing. The event was attended by many Nigerians across the U.S., Africans and other nationalities resident in America.

NEW YORK (AP) — A reputed Philadelphia mob boss known for beating murder raps, surviving attempts on his life and reinventing himself as a restaurateur is back in court facing federal fraud charges.
Opening statements in the trial of Joseph "Skinny Joey" Merlino are set for Tuesday in federal court in Manhattan.
Merlino, 55, was among nearly four dozen defendants arrested in a 2016 crackdown on an East Coast syndicate that prosecutors say committed crimes including extortion, loan-sharking, casino-style gambling, sports gambling, credit card fraud and health care fraud. It operated in New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Florida and New Jersey.
Most of the defendants pleaded guilty to lesser charges, with Merlino the only one so far to go to trial. He has pleaded not guilty to charges that he conspired to bill insurers for unnecessary and excessive prescriptions for expensive compound creams in exchange for kickbacks.
The government plans to call mob turncoats as witnesses, including an associate with the New York-based Genovese crime family who made secret recordings of conversations with Merlino. The recordings captured him "supervising a number of individuals, questioning whether certain associates were 'rats,' collecting illegal gambling debt, engaging in a fraud against health insurers and conducting at least one sit-down to resolve a debt," court papers say.
Another witness is a government agent who served a five-day suspension after being accused of mishandling cooperators and investigative reports in the case, a topic the judge ruled the defense could cover in cross-examination.
The trial had originally been scheduled to begin in mid-January but was postponed for two weeks after Merlino, who has been free on $5 million bond and living in Florida, sought treatment for chest pains and shortness of breath.
The sharp-dressing Merlino once controlled the remnants of a Philadelphia-south Jersey organized crime family that was decimated by a bloody civil war in the 1980s and 1990s. Federal authorities say he was frequently targeted by murder plots after rivals put a $500,000 murder contract on his head.
He became a main suspect in a failed hit on another mob figure on Halloween 1989, but was never charged. He also served time for a $350,000 armored truck heist that same year.
In 2001, a jury acquitted Merlino and six co-defendants of three counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder that could have put him in prison for life. He was convicted of lesser racketeering charges and served 12 years in prison before being released in 2011.
Merlino claimed that he retired from the mob for good by running an upscale Italian restaurant in Boca Raton. The since-closed restaurant was called Merlino's. In a 2013 interview, he said that life in the Mafia wasn't worth the stress of being double-crossed.
"Too many rats," he said. "I want no part of that."
The Yesha Council of Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria has criticized the cancellation of the April meeting of the Supreme Planning Committee of the Civil Administration for Judea and Samaria, due to the sanctions of administration workers.
The cancellation means a delay in building permits. A council statement said, "We will not allow a return to the days of freezing. The cancellation of the planning meetings is a technical freeze on the prime minister's decisions on the construction issue. We call on the defense minister and the prime minister to deal with this issue as soon as possible and to hold the planning meeting on time."
KINGSPORT, TN (WJHL)- This year the U.S. is in a rare path for the total solar eclipse happening August 21st. It’s the first time in a century a total eclipse will stretch coast to coast.
“It happens really, really close to the Tri-Cities,” Bays Mountain Planetarium Director Adam Thanz said.
Now a production about the eclipse made right here in the Tri-Cities is making its way across the country. A team of astronomers and staff at Bays Mountain Planetarium in Kingsport spent a year and a half creating a short film called “Totality,” it tells you everything you need to know about eclipses.
Now that show is playing at 33 other planetariums in the U.S. as people across the country plan to see the total solar eclipse.
“We knew how important the eclipse was going to be, we had to have a program about it,” Thanz said.
We talked with one student as he was leaving “Totality.”
“I thought it was very interesting, I learned a lot,” High school sophomore Nicholas Meredith said. “Now I’m even more excited for the solar eclipse.”
So what is a total solar eclipse? It’s where the sun, moon, and earth perfectly line up turning day in to night for a few minutes. Here in the Tri-Cities you’ll see 96 percent of sun blocked by the moon. You’ll also see some changes in the environment.
“The temperature change notice that, the wind will pick up, the animals will react,” Thanz said.
You’ll also get some one of a kind views.
“If you put your hand up first and then look that direction but blocking the sun near maximum to the left you’ll see Jupiter to the right you will see Venus in the sky in the middle of the day,” Thanz said.
Here in the Tri-Cities the partial eclipse will start at 1:07 p.m., and the maximum eclipse will happen at 2:36 p.m.
Thanz said because of limited parking there, they don’t recommend going to Bays Mountain to view the eclipse, they say your backyard is just as good.
If you want to learn about how eclipses occur and what they are like ahead of August 21st you can see “Totality” at Bays Mountain Planetarium through August 20th.
The show is about 25 minutes long and is shown Monday through Friday at 1 o’clock and 4 o’clock, then on Saturday and Sunday at 1, 4, and 5 p.m.

NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — A Manhattan woman has found herself in a world of legal troubles after posting a bad review of a local doctor online.
Michelle Levine tells CBS2 she’s already spent close to $20,000 fighting the million-dollar suit which accuses her of defamation, libel, and causing emotional distress.
The plaintiff is Dr. Joon Song, a gynecologist Levine says she visited once in August for an annual exam.
“After I got a bill for an ultrasound and a new patient visit, whatever that means, and it was not billed as an annual I wrote a review about it,” she told CBS2’s Lisa Rozner.
She says she complained to the doctor’s office, but nothing happened. The lengthy critical review, among other things, complained of “very poor and crooked” business practices and was posted on sites like Yelp, Zocdoc, and Healthgrades.
“And I gave them one star on Facebook, which they also put in their complaint,” Levine said.
After getting sued, Levine says she took down all her reviews but Dr. Song still wants her to pay around $1 million in damages plus legal fees.
“It’s been kind of a nightmare,” the defendant said. “I just have this doctor that’s been suing me for a Yelp review and he won’t go away.”
Dr. Song wouldn’t go on camera to discuss the suit, but his attorney sent a statement to CBS2 saying in part: “While everyone is entitled to their opinion, outright lies masquerading as reviews can inflict serious damage to a medical practice or small business.”
Legal experts say it’s important to choose your words carefully when reviewing a business online.
“Truth is an absolute defense,” attorney Steve Hyman said. “If you do that and don’t make a broader conclusion that they’re running a scam factory then you can write a truthful review that ‘I had a bad time with this doctor’.”
Other experts say it’s important not to make broad generalizations.
“If you’re going to make a factual assertion, be able to back that up and prove that fact,” Evan Mascagni from the Public Participation Project said.
Levine says despite the legal headache, she doesn’t regret writing her review and will continue to fight to the end if she has to.
A spokesperson for Yelp tells CBS2 New York needs stronger legislation to protect reviewers from lawsuits, but in general it encourages businesses to resolve issues directly with consumers instead of resorting to litigation.
A group was seen aboard a hot pink flamingo-shaped inflatable raft, floating down the Los Angeles River on Monday.The group of three appeared to lounge on the raft, which was seen floating in the Boyle Heights area around 1 p.m., then making its way into the Vernon area.Law enforcement officials eventually approached the three individuals, who got off the raft and pulled it off to the side of the river. Officials were seen speaking to the three and handing them what appeared to be tickets.Meantime, other law enforcement officials were seen looking through the contents inside the inflatable flamingo.The group then deflated the raft, stuffed it into a bag, loaded it into a car and left the area.The trio of YouTubers, who call themselves the "JoogSquad," said they've pulled a similar stunt before, but their previous raft wasn't quite as eye-catching as the bright pink flamingo.The three said they just wanted to bring a smile to peoples' faces on a Monday and didn't mean any harm, but they did have some concerns about the water they were rafting in. "Mainly we were just worried about needles and diseases really," one of the rafters said.
NEW YORK (AP) — English winger Jack Harrison has been transferred from Major League Soccer's New York City FC to Manchester City, which is owned by the same parent company.
NYC said Tuesday that Harrison, who made his debut for England's Under-21 team last year, has been lent to Middlesbrough of the second-tier League Championship through the end of this season.
Harrison, who turned 21 in November, had 14 goals in 59 matches during two seasons with NYC, which is part of City Football Group.

CLEVELAND (AP) — The leader of a breakaway Amish group in Ohio convicted in hair- and beard-cutting attacks is pushing to get his convictions overturned using arguments already rejected in court.
An attorney for 72-year-old Samuel Mullet Sr. says Mullet's previous lawyer made mistakes during trial and in prior appeals.
In a Monday court filing, prosecutors say there were no errors that amounted to Mullet's rights to due process being violated, and a judge should reject his request.
Defense attorneys say the 2011 hair- and beard-cutting attacks stemmed from family disputes. Prosecutors say the motive was religious, as hair and beards have spiritual significance in the Amish faith.
Mullet is serving an 11-year sentence. Of the 16 Amish community members convicted in the case, only Mullet remains imprisoned.
MONTREAL (AP) — The World Anti-Doping Agency is looking into possible integrity issues with urine-collection bottles that were redesigned after the Russian Olympic doping scandal.
WADA said it learned on Jan. 19, less than a month before the start of the Pyeongchang Games, that the bottles could be susceptible to manual opening upon freezing of a sample.
Investigators found that Russians were able to surreptitiously open bottles at the Sochi Olympics and exchange dirty urine samples with clean ones previously provided the same athlete.
That led to a redesign of the bottles, and WADA said if there is, in fact, a flaw, it "will raise concerns and questions."
Russia's Olympic committee has been banned from the Pyeongchang Games, and this weekend, the International Olympic Committee said it had approved 169 Russian athletes to compete as "Olympic Athletes from Russia."
BRUSSELS (AP) — European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini is meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address the issues of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and the chances of reinvigorating negotiations on the peace process.
Mogherini has joined many EU leaders in expressing disapproval of the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. She said during a joint media address Monday that "the only realistic solution to the conflict between Israel and Palestine is based on two states with Jerusalem as the capital of both."
Netanyahu insisted that what U.S. President Donald Trump did was "put facts squarely on the table. Peace is based on reality."
He said the reality of seeing Jerusalem as Israel's capital "doesn't obviate peace, it makes peace possible."

ATLANTA (AP) – Dansby Swanson hit an RBI single with two outs in the ninth inning and the Atlanta Braves, boosted by Freddie Freeman’s two home runs, beat the San Diego Padres 5-4 Monday night for a four-game sweep in their first series at SunTrust Park.
Swanson’s bases-loaded hit fell just in front of diving left fielder Allen Cordoba. The Braves have followed a five-game losing streak with five straight wins.
Freeman had four hits and drove in three runs. His second homer tied it in the eighth.
Jim Johnson (2-0) pitched the ninth.
Kurt Suzuki hit a one-out single in the Braves ninth off closer Brandon Maurer (0-1). With two outs, pinch runner Chase d’Arnaud advanced to third on Emilio Bonifacio’s bloop single in front of Cordoba’s dive.
An intentional walk to Ender Inciarte loaded the bases for Swanson, whose first career game-ending hit again fell beyond the reach of a charging Cordoba.
PLEASANT HOPE, Mo. (AP) — An employee has been seriously injured in an explosion at a pyrotechnics plant in southwest Missouri.
KSPR-TV reports that a fire subsequently broke out Tuesday at the AM Pyrotechnics plant in Pleasant Hope, which supplies big fireworks shows.
Fire Protection District Fire Chief Jake Agee says there was a report of a loud explosion and by the time firefighters arrived, more explosions had taken place.
Firefighters said most of the workers left the building before the fire, but one person remained inside.
Agee says the woman was removed from the building with serious injuries and flown to a hospital.
Agee says several fire departments responded to the blaze and that the cause of the explosion is under investigation.
Avigdor Liberman held the first-ever visit by an Israeli defense minister in Kigali, capital of Rwanda, on Monday, meeting with President Paul Kagame, Defense Minister James Kabarebe and Foreign Minister Louise Mushikiwabo.
Liberman told Kagame, "The visit to Rwanda has historical significance for the relations between the two countries. Rwanda and Israel share a desire for a better future for their citizens, partnerships and friendships that are being built." He stressed, "I am proud to be the first Israeli defense minister to visit your capital. The relations between the two countries are stronger and deeper than ever."
DETROIT (AP) — The mother of a G League basketball player who died in March after collapsing on the court during a game has filed a lawsuit accusing the NBA and the Detroit Pistons of negligence.

TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) — A mistaken report of a shooter prompted the lockdown of Travis Air Force Base in California on Wednesday in the midst of an emergency training exercise, officials said.
The base ordered people to shelter in place and lock their doors and windows. Gates were closed for more than an hour before the all-clear was given at the site 45 miles northeast of San Francisco .
"There were reports of gunshots at the Base Exchange. However, no shooter was found," a base Facebook posting reported.
"There was a security exercise underway at the base and somebody took that to be an active shooter and they went from there," said U.S. Rep. John Garamendi, who was briefed on the situation.
The false alarm came on a day marked by violence.
In Virginia, a gunman wounded Rep. Steve Scalise and several others during practice for a baseball game featuring congressional Republicans.
James T. Hodgkinson, 66, was fatally shot by police who had been guarding Scalise, the House majority whip.
In San Francisco, a UPS employee opened fire inside a package delivery facility, killing three co-workers and himself, authorities said.

For three quarters on Sunday afternoon, the Giants stuck right with the Dallas Cowboys.
Despite 12 games of epic injuries and incompetence, which had left several vocational corpses in its wake, from fired head coach Ben McAdoo to just-as-out-of-work general manager Jerry Reese, Big Blue was right with the superior Cowboys, who have more to play with and play for.
Then the fourth quarter started and a taut 10-10 tie morphed into a 30-10 rout. There was nothing fancy about the way Dallas did it, either. Simply, the Cowboys had an extra gear and the Giants didn’t.
Even without suspended running back Ezekiel Elliott, the Cowboys (7-6) had more than enough to vanquish the downtrodden Giants. Take future Hall of Fame tight end Jason Witten, for example.
Witten doesn’t catch that many passes anymore, but when he does he seems to do it in the end zone. To give his career some context, consider this: Of Witten’s 1,141 career receptions, 154 have come against the Giants.
For a Cowboys team almost impossible to root for, Witten is the rare ray of sunshine for a franchise that always goes dark well before the Super Bowl. If you don’t know his story, Witten had a rather turbulent childhood that eventually morphed into a stellar professional career that will almost certainly land him in Canton some day.
There were no such heartwarming narratives on the other sideline. The Giants (2-11) are an absolute, abject mess. It felt like they were a unit on Sunday for about 45 minutes, as they traded blows with the Cowboys, using a stout defense and an occasional passing game that had been taped together with retreads and neophytes. It wasn’t a matter of coaching, of tactics or execution on Sunday, the Giants just stink right now.
You saw the fourth-quarter wreckage. Someone named Rod Smith — not the great former Broncos wideout, mind you — gallop for a long touchdown. Quarterback Dak Prescott seemed to have his way with Big Blue’s defense from there, tossing two of his three TDs in the final quarter. Prescott finished with 332 passing yards, completing 20 of his 30 throws (66 percent), for a robust 137.1 rating.
Smith didn’t just have the 45-yard scoring run. He also had an 81-yard scoring reception. Of Smith’s 160 total yards, only 47 came on the ground. He was Dallas’ leading receiver on this day, besting even Dez Bryant, who had a 50-yard highlight-reel catch-and-run TD of his own. In all, eight Cowboys caught passes.
On the other side, Wayne Gallman led the Giants in rushing with a pedestrian 59 yards. Evan Engram led Big Blue in receiving, with four bland catches for 54 yards, including 35 on one grab.
Making matters worse for Big Blue was the fact that Cowboys’ all-world linebacker Sean Lee was everywhere. As if there were two of him on the field, Lee had 18 tackles, and seemed to amaze fans, friends, and FOX’s broadcast duo.
In a painful reminder that the Giants’ season has melted into indifference and ignominy, there were thousands of Cowboys fans in the stands. When Witten scored his touchdown, it almost sounded like the game was being played in Dallas.
And, of course, we had Eli Manning, who was coming off the epic embarrassment of being benched after 210 straight starts. And it was done for no other reason than McAdoo and Reese feeling like they had nothing else to do. I mean, benching a potential Hall of Famer for Geno Smith? Why not?
No, Manning didn’t come back with a bang. He didn’t short-circuit the scoreboard. But it was hard to expect much from him without his two best receivers, little to no running game, and a patchwork offensive line. Still, it was good to see Manning under center, where he belongs, where he had been every week, every game, every snap since 2004.
The Giants don’t belong in the playoffs, or in contention, but at least they didn’t embarrass themselves … for three quarters, anyway.

Page Six reports that Carey’s team is allegedly saying the technical difficulties she faced were actually a deliberate sabotage by Dick Clark Productions, intended to drum up ratings. They apparently received a scorching letter on the subject of Mariah Carey’s malfunctioning earpiece:
“You know her inner ears were NOT working and your entire production team did not set her up to win,” the manager, Stella Bulochnikov, wrote to Mark Shimmel, whose company produced Carey’s TV nightmare, which was broadcast live on ABC. “AND MARIAH KEPT TELLING THEM [something was wrong] ON STAGE IN REAL TIME,” Bulochnikov typed in all caps in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Post. “THEY KEPT IGNORING HER. SHE TOOK A HIT HONORING HER COMMITMENT TO YOU. I SHOULD HAVE PULLED HER OFF THE STAGE THIS IS SABOTAGE.”
Bulochnikov told Page Six that she doesn’t believe Carey was deliberately given bad equipment, but that producers took advantage of the situation, saying, “Once things went wrong, they took the decision to keep rolling and make her look like a train wreck for the ratings,” she added, “They owe her a public apology.”

Happy New Year.
MOSCOW (AP) — Six-time Olympic gold medalist Viktor Ahn wants to know why he has been barred from next month's Pyeongchang Games.
Ahn is a short-track speed skater who was born in South Korea but switched allegiance to Russia ahead of the 2014 Sochi Games. Russian officials say the International Olympic Committee has refused to grant Ahn an invitation amid its vetting of the country's athletes for possible doping links.
"It is outrageous that there is no concrete reason which explains my exclusion from the Olympics, and furthermore people now view me as an athlete who used doping," Ahn wrote in an open letter to IOC President Thomas Bach.
Competing in South Korea would have been "an especially significant part of my career for several reasons," said Ahn, who won his first three Olympic titles while competing for his native country. "I hope that the IOC will ultimately declare their reason for my exclusion, so I will be able to defend my honor and dignity."
Ahn's letter was published on Friday by the Russian Skating Union, hours before the IOC published its rules of conduct for Russian athletes and officials who will be at Pyeongchang.
All Russian athletes must sign an IOC-drafted integrity declaration confirming they are not currently under investigation for a doping violation, and agree to be removed from the team if their statement proves incorrect.
The spokesman for President Vladimir Putin, when asked about Ahn's letter, said Russia would support all athletes, whether they take part in the Olympics or are barred.
"Intensive contacts are under way with the International Olympic Committee to clarify the situation and so that the interests of our athletes who are able to take part in the Olympics are completely secured and respected," spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
"There are athletes who are disputing their rights in a legal context. There are athletes who are appealing to public opinion. There are athletes who are appealing to the Olympic committee leadership. That is their right."
The IOC hasn't confirmed which Russians will be invited to compete in Pyeongchang, and hasn't explained any individual decisions. However, it has said newly obtained records from the Moscow anti-doping laboratory played a role in the decision-making.
Russia announced 169 athletes would represent the "Olympic Athlete from Russia" (OAR) team on Thursday. The list didn't contain Ahn or some other Russian medal contenders, including cross-country skiing world champion Sergei Ustyugov and biathlete Anton Shipulin.
The IOC refusals for some are separate from the doping bans for 43 Russian athletes because of what the Olympic body ruled was a doping program and cover-up at the Sochi Games. Of those, 42 have launched appeals at the Court of Arbitration for Sport, and verdicts in 39 cases heard in Geneva are due to be published next week.
Strict rules imposed on Russian medal winners in Pyeongchang were published in the IOC conduct guidelines Friday.
The official Russian flag can be hung in an athlete's bedroom in Olympic villages, though with "no public visibility."
Inside Olympic venues, athletes must not accept the Russian flag from a spectator nor sing the national anthem.
"Any 'alternate' victory ceremonies organized for OAR athletes and/or team officials are not permitted."
Also, the International Biathlon Union said it could cancel a World Cup in Russia in March in light of "newly available information."
The IBU didn't say what it received, though the IOC said on Wednesday it was sharing doping-related information from its vetting process with international sports federations.
The World Cup in Tyumen is due to be the first in Russia since 2015.

BRISTOL, VA (WJHL)- Tuesday night people in Bristol, Virginia showed up to their city council meeting to make it known they have concerns over potential future budget cuts for the city.
Debbie Sourbeer asked people on social media to show up to Tuesday night’s meeting in an effort to show the city council how they feel.
Sourbeer said it all started last week after she attended a city council meeting where she said she heard the city may have to make cuts to all departments this upcoming budget year.
Sourbeer told us Tuesday afternoon when she heard that, her immediate concern was any potential budget cuts to the emergency services.
Even though city council members aren’t expected to dive into the budget just yet, Sourbeer said she wanted to make it clear to Bristol city leaders they don’t want them to cut anything that has to do with safety and emergency workers.
“If they know how everyone feels about this, maybe they will start thinking when they do the new budget, and make the cuts, maybe they will see we are here to support them and we really don’t want that to happen,” Sourbeer said.
When we spoke to Mayor Bill Hartley over the phone Tuesday afternoon, he said the budget won’t be presented to the council until either the end of March or early April.
Hartley said it was too early to tell where things stood in terms of funding for different departments.

Taipei, Feb. 3 (CNA) Dialogue between the Holy See and China, especially regarding the appointment of Chinese bishops, does not mean that the two countries will establish diplomatic ties, Archbishop of Taipei John Hung Shan-chuan said Saturday, commenting on media reports of a significant breakthrough in China-Vatican ties.
Reuters reported Thursday that a framework accord between the two countries on the appointment of bishops in China was ready and "could be signed in a few months," citing an unnamed senior Vatican source.
The report said that even a partial resolution of that contentious issue could open the way for the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Vatican and China.
Speaking with CNA on Saturday, however, Hung dismissed those claims, saying that the potential for Beijing and the Vatican to establish diplomatic relations make headlines every year but never end up being true.
Hung said the Holy See maintains diplomatic ties with countries based solely on shared values of freedom, democracy, and human rights, and Taiwan has been proactive in championing all those values.
Taiwan has put in a lot of effort and money into the humanitarian initiatives spearheaded by the Vatican, and Pope Francis has reciprocated by showing similar care for Taiwan, Hung said.
He said the Church would know if in fact something happening regarding the diplomatic ties between Taiwan and the Holy See, but currently there is no such information within the Church.
Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Friday that the recent China-Vatican talks had nothing to do with politics, and that the Taiwan government would continue to strengthen its ties with the Vatican and monitor the situation in Beijing.
China does not allow its diplomatic allies to maintain formal ties with Taiwan, which means that if the Vatican decides to switch sides, it would have to sever its diplomatic relations with Taiwan. (By Lee Ming-zong and Kuan-lin Liu)

CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — The owner of a seaplane that crashed near Sydney during a New Year's Eve joy flight, killing the Canadian pilot and his five British passengers, says that flight path was not authorized.
The Australian Transport Safety Bureau on Wednesday released a preliminary report on its investigation into the cause of the de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver crash into the Hawkesbury River.
Sydney Seaplanes chief executive Aaron Shaw said in response to the report that its key question was why the plane was flying in a bay surrounded by steep terrain that had no exit.
Shaw said in a statement Sydney Seaplanes had not authorized the route and "the plane simply should not have been where it was."
The report rules out potential causes but does not suggest any likely cause.
How should educators confront bigotry, racism and white supremacy? The incidents in Charlottesville, Va., this past weekend pushed that question from history to current events.
One teacher wondering aloud about his role is Derek Weimer. He taught James Alex Fields Jr., the man charged with murdering a woman and injuring multiple others by driving his car into a crowd of anti-racist marchers this weekend.
Weimer says he taught Fields in three classes at Cooper High School in Union, Ky. As NPR reported, he told member station WVXU reporter Bill Rinehart:
Weimer says Fields was intelligent and didn't cause trouble. But he says the quiet boy was also deeply into Adolf Hitler and white supremacy. Weimer says he did his best to steer Fields away from those interests and thought he had succeeded in doing so. On hearing about the incident in Charlottesville, Weimer said he felt that he failed as a teacher.
For 40 years, the nonprofit Facing History and Ourselves has been training teachers to confront racism and bigotry. By studying the moral decisions facing people at historical moments, from Reconstruction to Kristallnacht to the civil rights era, they hope "to empower students to work against bigotry and injustice or improper uses of power," says Roger Brooks, president and CEO. "We sum everything up by saying people make choices and choices make history."
Studies show that the curriculum produces academic, social and emotional gains in students. A time like this, says Brooks, is the ultimate teachable moment:
"There's a whole lot teachers can slow down and unpack with their students rather than get completely caught up in the emotion of the moment."
Indeed, just hours after the attack, teachers were sharing resources online, and we heard from more after reaching out in our newsletter. Here are some resources and ideas for the fast-approaching school year.
Just starting out
More than 80 percent of public school teachers are white, while half of all students are people of color. Some teachers may never have directly talked about race or racism, particularly with younger children. Brooks suggests they start by making an "identity chart". This is a way to find commonalities as well as celebrate differences.
Diverse books: Some teachers will introduce topics of racism, civil rights and diversity, especially to younger students, through books. Here is a curated list of 50 social justice books from the nonprofit Teaching for Change. Here is a second, broken down by grade level, by The National Network of State Teachers of the Year.
Teaching Tolerance has lesson plans for students as young as kindergarten that cover bias and social justice.
Historical background
The Graduate Student Coalition for Liberation at The University of Virginia in Charlottesville published a syllabus on Medium that includes primary and secondary historical resources on the local history of segregationism, as well as the urban renewal that displaced African-Americans in the city. There is also background on the dispute over the statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee that was the focal point of the rally this past weekend.
Facing History and Ourselves is an evidence-based social studies curriculum for middle and high school students that grounds discussions of racism and prejudice in students' own moral dilemmas.
American Federation for Teachers president, Randi Weingarten, shared some collections of lesson plans from AFT's Share My Lesson platform: on racial profiling and stereotyping, on civil rights and social justice, on bullying and helping children cope with traumatic events.
Ripped from the headlines
The Atlantic contributing writer Melinda Anderson created the hashtag #CharlottesvilleCurriculum on Twitter to serve as an ongoing list of resources to teach responsively to current events. Sources highlighted include the Equal Justice Initiative and the Citizenship and Social Justice Curriculum.
To help make sense of the news, the Critical Media Project of the University of Southern California offers lesson plans and resources for talking about media literacy as it relates to race, ethnicity and identity.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — An eye-catching Los Angeles hot dog stand designed in the 1940s to look like a giant wiener on a bun has found a home a decade after closing.
The Tail o' the Pup, which fed working people and Hollywood stars for 60 years, will be moved Thursday for permanent display at Valley Relics Museum, home to many pop culture items. The unique structure, which appeared in TV shows and movies and was named a Los Angeles cultural landmark, has been in a storage yard since its walk-up window shut for the final time in 2005.
Nicole Miller, whose husband Jay's family has owned the Pup since the 1970s, said they'd hoped to find a new location to serve its famous all-beef franks once again, but couldn't secure permits.
The family is glad the museum "is willing to take it, restore it, and put it on display," she told the Los Angeles Daily News (http://bit.ly/2saLuci ).
The chicken wire and stucco dog measured 18 feet from nose to tail with a line of mustard running across its service window.
Designed by architect Milton Black and opened in 1946, the Tail o' the Pup was built to catch the attention of passing motorists during an era when cars were king.
It's a rare surviving example of when giant doughnuts, chili bowls and coffee cups dotted Los Angeles curbs from the 1920s to after World War II, the newspaper said.
"The Tail o' the Pup was clearly among the best known of the 'programmatic' buildings — buildings that often looked like products sold inside," said Cindy Olnick of the Los Angeles Conservancy, a preservation group. "The whole building, besides the sign, was an advertisement."

Bonsai's Inkling programming language, which makes it easier to build artificial intelligence applications, is moving closer to a 1.0 release.
Part of the Bonsai Platform for AI, Inkling is aÂ proprietary higher level language that compiles down to Google's open source TensorFlow library for machine intelligence. Inkling is designed to represent AI in terms of what a developer wants to teach the system instead of focusing on low-level mechanics. It abstracts away from dynamic AI algorithms that would otherwise require expertise in machine learning. Declarative and strongly typed, the language resembles a cross between Python and SQL from a syntactic perspective, said Bonsai CEO Mark Hammond.
[ The art of programming moves rapidly. InfoWorld helps you navigate whatâs running hot and what's going cold. | Keep up with main topics in programming with InfoWorldâs App Dev Report newsletter. ]
"Our core focus right now is on enabling enterprises and industrial companies to build control and optimization systems," which could take forms such as advanced robotics, supply chain optimization systems, or oil exploration, Hammond said. A 1.0 release of the language and the Bonsai Platform is targeted for late June. Plans call for eventually promoting development of additional implementations of Inkling. The company itself is focused on making machine learning technologies accessible to developers and engineers without a background in this area but who do have expertise in domain areas where they want to apply the technology.
Bonsai Platform currently is in an early access stage of release. Other components of the it include the Bonsai Artificial Intelligence Engine; command line and web interfaces; and simulators, generators, and data as training sources.

MIAMI (AP) — A judge has decided that Florida school shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz should continue to be represented by a public defender at taxpayer expense.
Broward County Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer's ruling Tuesday says Cruz has at most $28,000 in assets. Scherer says that's not enough money to hire a private lawyer in a potential death penalty case of this magnitude.
The 19-year-old Cruz is charged with 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted murder in the Feb. 14 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. He is being held without bail.
Cruz's lawyers have said he will plead guilty if prosecutors waive the death penalty. The Broward County state attorney's office has not been willing to do that.

Syrian Kurds reacted with rage to videos showing Turkish-backed rebels mutilating and filming the body of a fallen female Kurdish fighter.
The young woman, Barin Kobani, joined the YPJ's all-women unit in 2015, and was fighting the Turks in northwest Syria when she was killed earlier this week.
According to Kurdish officials, the Turkish forces "played with her corpse" and mutilated it. Videos show Kobani's bloodied body with what seems to be cuts in the torso, surrounded by a group of Turkish rebels.
An unconfirmed report said Kobani was captured alive and then killed.
Turkey has not commented on the incident, but Kurdish authorities said they hold the Turkish government responsible, and called the perpetrators "Syria's terrorist allies."
The Syrian National Council condemned the mutilation and called to "punish those responsible."
WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand's Pacific Challenge rugby test with Samoa on Friday will be important viewing for the British and Irish Lions eight days out from their series-opening test.
While the Lions have seen individual All Blacks in action for Super Rugby teams so far on tour, Friday's match will give the tourists the first glimpse of a full All Blacks team and a better sense of the challenge awaiting them in the three-test series.
At the same time, the All Blacks have had a chance to assess the British and Irish squad in four tour matches to date and will gain more detailed knowledge of their opponents when the Lions field a near test-strength lineup against the New Zealand Maori on Saturday.
New Zealand has selected a strong lineup to face Samoa, and Lions coach Warren Gatland believes it provides insight into their selection thinking and the style they will adopt.
"It's close to their test team, I think," Gatland said. "It looks like their strongest side.
"They're trying to get a game under their belts. I'm not sure they'll make many changes from that game against Samoa to the following weeks."
The All Blacks and Lions have something in common in the weekend matches as both will start under new captains. New Zealand captain Kieran Read will miss the Samoa match as he continues his recovery from a broken thumb and fullback Ben Smith will lead the team for the first time.
The Lions have named tour captain Sam Warburton on the bench for the match against the Maori, elevating Ireland flanker Peter O'Mahony to the captaincy. In doing so they have provided the strongest indication yet that Warburton, recovering from an ankle injury, may not be fit for the first test.
The All Blacks and Lions also have in common a strong sense of respect for their opponents this weekend. The Lions lost to the Maori when the teams last met in 2005. The All Blacks were lucky to beat Samoa 25-16 in their most-recent meeting in Samoa in 2015.
Head coach Steve Hansen said the All Blacks were focusing closely on the Samoa match.
"Whilst we asked for this game to help us prepare for the Lions series, once it became a reality it then took on its own importance," he said. "Samoa is about to kick off the qualifying stage of their Rugby World Cup campaign so this will make them even more dangerous."
All Blacks selectors will look closely at the form of scrumhalf Aaron Smith, under pressure from T.J. Perenara, and center Sonny Bill Williams, who could start against the Lions if Ryan Crotty is unfit. Hooker Codie Taylor is in line to start ahead of Dane Coles, who is concussed and will need to reassure the selectors that he is fit.
Samoa will use the match as a springboard into midyear tests, which include World Cup qualifying games during the Pacific Nations Cup.
"The boys know they are playing the best team in the world and they know if they don't get it right it's going to be a long day," Samoa coach and former All Black Alama Ieremia said. "We have to be smart."
Friday's Pacific Challenge is a rarity which will see two test matches played at the same venue on the same day. Before the All Blacks play Samoa, Wales will play Tonga at Eden Park.
Wales will be without regular starters who are touring with the Lions and will use Friday's match to give a new generation of talent some test experience. Tonga welcomes a rare opportunity to play a top tier nation.
Veteran center Jamie Roberts will lead Wales for the first time and said they will have to be at their physical best to hold out Tonga's challenge.
"When you play against the Pacific island teams, if you don't match these guys physically you're in for a long day," Roberts said. "You have to take the game to them.
"They've got threats across the park and certainly they're pretty special athletes."
HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — Vietnam has declared a California-based exile group a terrorist organization after 15 local members were convicted in a failed bombing of the country's largest airport.
The attempted attack at the Tan Son Nhat airport in Ho Chi Minh City in April caused a scare but no casualties. The communist government linked it to the Provisional Central Government of Vietnam, an exile group little known locally but tied to the defeated U.S-backed South Vietnamese republic.
The Ministry of Public Security said in a statement Wednesday that the group is a terrorist organization and those associated with it will be dealt with in accordance with law.
Another group, the California-based Vietnam Reform Party or Viet Tan, was declared a terrorist organization in 2016 and was accused of sending arms and planning attacks.

Almost 48 hours after violence engulfed Charlottesville, Va., President Trump called out white nationalist groups by name. Trump's remarks on Monday followed criticism that his initial statement about the clash of protesters did not condemn racist groups specifically.
"Racism is evil, and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans," the president said from the White House.
Trump began his remarks talking about his economic accomplishments and plans for trade negotiations before turning his attention to the events over the weekend in Virginia. After the Charlottesville City Council had voted earlier this year to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from one of its parks, white nationalist groups — including white supremacists, the alt-right, the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis — descended on the city for a "Unite the Right" rally.
On Friday night, they marched on the normally sleepy college town, home to the University of Virginia, carrying torches. On Saturday conditions turned deadly as hundreds of the white nationalists, some carrying Confederate flags and shields and others in militia-like gear, clashed with counterprotesters in the city streets.
At one point a silver Dodge Challenger, allegedly driven by 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. of Ohio, rammed into a street filled with counterprotesters. Heather Heyer, 32, was killed, and at least 19 others were injured. Fields was charged with one count of second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of hit and run.
President Trump expressed sympathy to Heyer's family as well as to the families of Virginia State Troopers Lt. H. Jay Cullen and Berke M.M. Bates, who died when their helicopter that was patrolling Saturday's event crashed.
"These three fallen Americans embody the goodness and decency of our nation," Trump said. "In times such as these, America has always shown its true character, responding to hate with love, division with unity, and violence with an unwavering resolve for justice."
Trump spoke after meeting with newly installed FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the White House. He said that the Department of Justice had opened a civil rights investigation into the car attack.
"To anyone who acted criminally at this weekend's racist violence, you will be held fully accountable. Justice will be delivered," the president said.
Sessions told ABC News on Monday morning that the car crash that had killed Heyer "does meet the definition of domestic terrorism."
"You can be sure we will charge and advance the investigation towards the most serious charges that can be brought, because this is unequivocally an unacceptable, evil attack," he said.
The president's condemnations may be too little, too late for those who criticized Trump's initial remarks — and Trump may have missed a critical moment to be the nation's healer in chief. On Saturday, Trump claimed that the clashes were a result of "hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides." Top Republicans, among others, quickly criticized him for not calling out by name the white supremacists, alt-right, KKK and neo-Nazi groups that began the protests.
"Mr. President — we must call evil by its name. These were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism," Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who heads up the GOP Senate campaign committee, tweeted on Saturday.
The White House put out an unsigned statement on Sunday morning, saying that, "The President said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry and hatred and of course that includes white Supremacists, KKK, neo-nazi and all extremist groups. He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together."
Vice President Pence had gone further than the president in his own comments, telling reporters Sunday night while traveling in Colombia, "We have no tolerance for hate and violence from white supremacists, neo-Nazis or the KKK. These dangerous fringe groups have no place in American public life and in the American debate, and we condemn them in the strongest possible terms."
Trump has been blamed for being slow to criticize white supremacist groups in the past — even as he regularly attacks other targets on Twitter. During the 2016 campaign, Trump came under fire for not immediately disavowing the endorsement of David Duke, a former KKK grand wizard.
Duke, who attended the march in Virginia, said on Saturday that participants' aim was "to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump. That's what we believed in. That's why we voted for Donald Trump, because he said he's going to take our country back."
Duke later responded to one of the president's tweets condemning the violence by saying, "I would recommend you take a good look in the mirror & remember it was White Americans who put you in the presidency, not radical leftists."
TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) joined a Hello Kitty costume character on Saturday to open the Pingtung Tropic Agriculture Expo in southern Taiwan and even took a selfie with a rice farm on which an image of Hello Kitty and friends was shown through different colors of rice.
The rice farm with special images has proved popular among visitors. After collaborating with Sony Pictures to create the image of “Resident Evil” in 2017, the county government decided to work with Sanrio this year, with the hope of attracting the fans of one of the most popular fictional characters in the world. Through the picture one can see two Hello Kitty characters with five friends extending across a huge rice farm.
► 2018 Pingtung Tropic Agriculture Expo (Screen capture of President Tsai Ing-wen's Facebook page)
According to the event organizer, the image is created by different types of rice seedlings which, after being cultivated, have come up with five colors of rice leaves, including purple, white, yellow, black, and green.
The organizer said the special seedlings were provided and controlled by the Taiwan Agriculture Research Institute, and that they were for appreciation only.
During the opening remark, President Tsai recommended families take a trip to the fair, for it was combined with land art and several workshops related to farming and food-making.
The president said the expo demonstrated the county’s agricultural development, such as cocoa production. Although many people in Taiwan might know little about Pingtung’s cocoa and coffee beans, their high quality had been recognized in international competitions, added the president.
Apart from Hello Kitty and cocoa, there are 12 other sections where visitors can appreciate a huge garden, experience horse-riding, and buy local produce and seafood, according to the county government.
The agriculture expo will remain open until March 4 and admission is free. For more information, please visit the website.
HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A district attorney ruled Monday that state police acted properly a year ago when they shot and killed a man they suspected of murdering a state trooper in a rural area of central Pennsylvania.
Huntingdon County District Attorney David Smith issued his decision in the Dec. 31 death in Hesston of 32-year-old Jason Robison.
The two-page report said troopers searching for Robison found him inside a camper not far from where Trooper Landon Weaver had been killed.
Smith said the investigators retreated and secured the area, and a short time later, Robison appeared at the camper door, holding a pistol.
"Troopers at the scene ordered Robison numerous times to drop his gun, which he refused to do," Smith wrote. "Robison moved as if to advance from the camper while still holding the pistol in his hand. After Robison began to move, members of the state police fired shots at Robison, who was struck in the head, torso, arms and legs."
A .32-caliber Beretta pistol was recovered beside Robison's body. It contained eight live rounds, and there were two other bullets in the pocket of his jacket.
The prosecutor deemed the killing as justified and said authorities will not the release the names of troopers involved.
Investigators said earlier this year they recovered 22 spent rounds from the scene, none that matched Robison's gun.
Weaver had gone to Robison's home to investigate an alleged violation of a protective order for texting his ex-girlfriend.
Robison's mother, Sherry Lou Robison, told investigators her son pulled a handgun out of his pants and walked toward the trooper. She then heard a popping sound and saw Weaver fall to the floor, bleeding.
Weaver, 23, had been with the state police for about a year. He had been married about six months before his murder.

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — Hamas says one of its senior officials has died, three weeks after accidentally shooting himself while cleaning his weapon in Gaza.
Spokesman Hazem Qassem said on Tuesday that Imad al-Alami had been unconscious since the Jan. 9 shooting.
Hamas initially hastily announced al-Alami died naturally but later said he shot himself while checking his weapon at his Gaza City home and was in critical condition.
The 62-year-old al-Alami held several key posts as a member of Hamas' policy-making body and lived in Syria before returning to Gaza in 2012. He remained a prominent official though not a member of the current politburo.
After the 2014 Israel-Hamas war, he traveled to Turkey for treatment for an injury in which he lost a leg. Hamas said he was wounded in the war.

CALGARY, Alberta (AP) — Jonathan Marchessault scored the go-ahead goal and added an assist as the Vegas Golden Knights scored three times in the final two minutes Tuesday night for a 4-2 victory over the Calgary Flames.
Just 10 seconds after Erik Haula tied it 2-all at 18:14 of the third period, Marchessault got around Mark Giordano and beat Calgary goalie Mike Smith over his glove.
David Perron scored into an empty net and Reilly Smith also had a goal for Western Conference-leading Vegas (33-12-4) in the opener of a six-game road trip.
Matthew Tkachuk got his seventh goal in the last eight games for the Flames (25-17-8), who lost in regulation for the first time in 12 games. They had gone 7-0-4 since last losing in regulation on Dec. 29. Sam Bennett also scored for Calgary.
The tying goal was a weird one. Calgary forward Michael Frolik got the puck in his own end and ended up firing it toward a surprised Smith. He stopped it with his pad but Haula put in the rebound, stunning the home crowd.
Calgary took a 2-1 lead at 18:43 of the second on a beautiful wraparound goal by Tkachuk.
The 20-year-old faked as though he was carrying the puck behind the net and spun back in the other direction. Not realizing that, goalie Marc-Andre Fleury left both feet to desperately dive headfirst toward the far post, only for Tkachuk to tuck the puck inside the near post.
Trailing 1-0 after the first period, the Flames tied it 6:02 into the second when Bennett slid a puck under Fleury as he cut in off the wing.
Vegas opened the scoring at 16:03 of the first when its sizzling power play converted its first try of the night. As he skated through the slot, Reilly Smith deflected Marchessault's point shot past Mike Smith.
Mike Smith responded right after that with perhaps his biggest stop of the night. Less than 20 seconds later, William Karlsson got behind the Calgary defense, but as he attempted a deke, Mike Smith smothered the shot with his trapper.
Mike Smith finished with 31 stops and fell to 20-14-6.
Fleury, tested 33 times, improved to 13-4-2.
NOTES: Frolik (jaw) was back in the lineup after missing 12 games. He returned to his spot on a line with Mikael Backlund and Tkachuk. ... It was the first of four matchups between the teams this season. ... Haula and Perron extended their point streaks to six games.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Unification is an idea that moves most Koreans, North and South, on an emotional level.
For some, especially young people in the South, it may not be a burning issue. Details like the costs, the risks and what specifically both sides stand to gain are rarely given much thought by anyone who isn't an academic, politician or activist.
But when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in meet on Friday, the prospect of unification, even if only in the abstract, will loom large around them.
Can Kim's nuclear-armed North and the K-pop capitalism of Moon's South ever merge into One Korea? Both leaders come to the table with distinct visions of what that would look like. And they are very different.
___
THE DEMOCRATIC FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF KORYO
After failing to take the South by force in the 1950s, North Korea's founder and "eternal president," Kim Il Sung, announced a plan for what he thought a unified Korea should look like back in 1980.
He called it the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo. Koryo was an ancient Korean kingdom from which the word Korea is derived.
Kim's plan was for an arrangement something along the lines of what Hong Kong has with China, a unified nation with two separate systems of government.
Under his plan, the North and South would respect each other's ideology, social system and autonomy. Both sides would have an equal number of representatives in a supreme national assembly with equal rights and responsibilities. The assembly would also have representatives of Koreans overseas. It would have a standing committee that would administer state affairs.
Kim stressed the need for this new federation to remain neutral and independent, avoiding in particular military alliances with others.
Not surprisingly, that looks a lot like North Korea today, with its Supreme People's Assembly, and the party's Politburo and Central Committee overseeing day-to-day policies. Even the name smacks of the North, which is officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
An equal number of assembly seats would be a good deal for the North, which has half the South's population. The inclusion of Koreans overseas would boost that advantage even further since, for historical reasons, more often than not they have at least nominal allegiance to Pyongyang, not Seoul.
With so many devils lurking in the details, Kim's grand plan has never gotten much traction.
___
A KOREAN COMMONWEALTH AND BEYOND
South Korea's three-step proposal ends in a similarly predictable place: its own system writ large across the peninsula.
The first priority, according to South Korea's Unification Ministry, is to develop a sustainable relationship and resolve the issue of North Korea's development of nuclear weapons.
Seoul wants to substitute the unstable armistice that ended the fighting of the 1950-53 Korean War with a permanent peace treaty — a goal Pyongyang shares. This step could get a boost on Friday — it will almost certainly be taken up then and probably again at the summit between Kim and President Donald Trump in May or early June.
South Korea wants to then develop trust and cooperation to the point where a sort of national consensus has been achieved. After a transitional commonwealth period, the next step would be the formation of a single market on the Korean Peninsula "to create new growth engines and create an inter-Korean economic community of coexistence and co-prosperity."
"We will build a new economic order that will bring peace and prosperity to the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia," the ministry concludes.
The essentials of this plan were announced by President Roh Tae-woo in September 1989.
The succession of administrations that have taken office in the South since Roh have adhered fairly predictably to the principle of gradual, peaceful progress, while calibrating their willingness to engage with Pyongyang based on their assessment of its level of vulnerability or hostility.
In the long run, however, it makes no provision for a one-state, two-system future.
Ultimately, Seoul believes, the North Korean system has to go.

The University of Adelaide has recruited SA Water’s chief information officer to be its second-ever CIO.
The university didn’t offer a starting date for Bev McQuade’s new role, but said she would join the university some time in the next three months.
The university in November said it would conduct a global search for a new IT leader, after its inaugural CIO, Mark Gregory, left for Flinders University.
“After a thorough international and national search process I am very pleased to announce the appointment of Bev McQuade to this important position for the University,” Adelaide Uni’s chief operation office, Bruce Lines, said in a statement.
McQuade has been CIO at SA Water for eight years. At the university she will oversee a 250-strong Technology Branch and an annual budget of $60 million.
“Like all other sectors, higher education is undergoing a digital transformation,” Lines said. “The University of Adelaide wants to ensure technology is delivering the very best experience for its students and staff, whether it is in the classroom, engaging with University processes or undertaking learning and research out in the region and internationally.
“Bev possesses a demonstrated commitment to identifying and meeting the business needs of organisations via technology, which makes her an ideal appointment for the university, particularly as we attempt to operate at the forefront of online-enabled education and deliver high performance computing solutions for high-end research. She is very enthusiastic to be joining the university.”
LONDON (AP) — London police say they have arrested a 24-year-old-man who allegedly tried to climb a wall outside Buckingham Palace on Sunday night.
The Metropolitan Police said Monday the suspect didn't have any weapons on him and "the incident is not being treated as terrorist related."
He was arrested on suspicion of trespass and suspicion of possessing a controlled substance.
The department said its Royalty and Specialist Protection Command arrested the man after he allegedly stepped over a low fence and tried to scale a wall outside the palace.
Buckingham Palace is the official home of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, although she is often at one of her other residences.
Police say he was given a mental health assessment and released on conditional bail.
He must report to London police in January.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Michael Flynn's conversations with a Russian diplomat roiled the White House and put a spotlight on a little-enforced law prohibiting U.S. citizens from trying to influence a foreign government in disputes with the United States.
Flynn resigned as national security adviser after conceding that he may have discussed U.S. sanctions in phone calls with Russia's ambassador to the United States while Barack Obama was still in office. Those conversations may have violated the Logan Act, which aims to bar private citizens from conducting diplomacy, though White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Tuesday that no legal issues arose.
Still, the centuries-old act has been so rarely invoked that legal experts say it may no longer be valid. And no one has been found guilty of violating the act in its more than 200-year history.
A look at the Logan Act and whether such conversations could lead to charges.
WHAT IS THE LOGAN ACT?
Lawmakers enacted the Logan Act in 1799 after George Logan, a friend of Thomas Jefferson, made a private visit to France in an attempt to ease tensions with the United States after the French Revolution. That trip was sharply criticized back home as an inappropriate interference in affairs between the two countries, prompting the passage of the law.
HAS IT EVER BEEN USED BEFORE?
Since then, there appear to have been very few indictments, and no prosecutions, under the obscure act. Legal experts say that would make potential violations even harder to prove in court.
The one known indictment came in 1803 after a Kentucky farmer wrote a newspaper article advocating for a separate country within the United States that would ally with France. But no prosecution followed.
"It really is an anachronism," written during a very different time in diplomatic and constitutional history, said Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. "The statue was written at a time when Congress thought it had the power to criminalize this kind of ill-conceived, but not illegal, speech."
Over the years, politicians and public figures have been accused of violating the Logan Act, often by political rivals. The Rev. Jesse Jackson's diplomatic activities in several countries in the 1980s, including trips to Cuba to negotiate the release of prisoners, raised questions about whether he violated the act. So did former NBA star Dennis Rodman's travels to North Korea to meet with dictator Kim Jong Un in 2014. Another allegation involved a letter sent by 47 Republican senators to Iran's leaders in 2015, warning them against making a nuclear deal with Obama.
None of those cases yielded criminal charges. A court could find the Logan Act no longer valid under a legal doctrine that says statutes become unenforceable if they are never used.
IF FLYNN DISCUSSED SANCTIONS, DIDN'T HE BREAK THE LAW?
Discussing economic sanctions against Russia with the Russian envoy during the American presidential transition could have been a violation of the act. But that doesn't mean it will result in charges against Flynn. Prosecutors, for questions of resources or interpretations of the law, sometimes opt not to pursue criminal cases even when presented with a clear violation. And when it comes to the Logan Act, they would have to overcome a difficult defense that Flynn's phone calls were protected free speech. They would also have to prove Flynn was actually acting without the authority of the United States, Vladeck said.
And then find a prosecutor willing to take the case.
A U.S. official told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the FBI interviewed Flynn about his actions with the ambassador. But the content of the conversations is unclear.
The official was briefed on the investigation but was not authorized to discuss it by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.
If Flynn lied to investigators, he would have opened himself up to a possible felony prosecution for making false statements.
But Vladeck called threats to prosecute under the Logan Act "an increasingly empty gesture."
"It's a fun game for commentators to play," he said. "It's a way of turning what looks like a really bad move into a potentially illegal one."

NEW YORK (AP) — Just a week after scientists reported evidence that our species left Africa earlier than we thought, another discovery is suggesting the date might be pushed back further.
Homo sapiens arose in Africa at least 300,000 years ago and left to colonize the globe. Scientists think there were several dispersals from Africa, not all equally successful. Last week's report of a human jaw showed some members of our species had reached Israel by 177,000 to 194,000 years ago.
Now comes a discovery in India of stone tools, showing a style that has been associated elsewhere with our species. They were fashioned from 385,000 years ago to 172,000 years ago, showing evidence of continuity and development over that time. That starting point is a lot earlier than scientists generally think Homo sapiens left Africa.
This tool style has also been attributed to Neanderthals and possibly other species. So it's impossible to say whether the tools were made by Homo sapiens or some evolutionary cousin, say researchers who reported the finding Wednesday in the journal Nature .
"We are very cautious on this point" because no human fossils were found with the tools, several authors added in a statement.
It's not clear how much the tool development reflects arrival of populations or ideas from outside India, versus being more of a local development, said one author, Shanti Pappu of the Sharma Centre for Heritage Education in Chennai, India.
The tool-making style was a change from older stone tools found at the site, featuring a shift to smaller flakes, for example.
Michael Petraglia, an archaeologist who specializes in human evolution in Asia but didn't participate in the work, said he did not think the tools show that our species had left Africa so long ago.
"I simply don't buy it," said Petraglia of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany.
Instead, he said, he believes one of our evolutionary cousins in India developed the tool style independently of outside influence. The tools at the site northwest of Chennai in southeastern India are closely related to the older tool-making style there and seem to represent a transition, he said.
The idea that they reflect knowledge brought in from elsewhere would be tough to prove in India, he said. The country has few well-studied archaeological sites and only one fossil find from this period, from a forerunner of Homo sapiens that was associated with the earlier style of tool-making, Petraglia said.

BEIJING (AP) — China has criticized proposed U.S. investment controls as a violation of global trade rules and says it reserves the right to retaliate if they take effect.
The Commerce Ministry's comment Thursday came as the two sides prepared for weekend talks in Beijing on American complaints about China's trade surplus and Beijing's promise to buy more American goods.
A ministry spokesman, Gao Feng, said the White House proposal to restrict Chinese investment in the United States violates the "rules and basic spirit" of the World Trade Organization.
Gao said, "The Chinese side will carefully evaluate the U.S. measures and reserves the right to take corresponding measures."
This week marks the world premiere of Frame by Frame, The National Ballet of Canada's new full length ballet based on the life and work of innovative filmmaker Norman McLaren. While those outside of the cinephile community might not be familiar with McLaren's work, he is commonly credited with advancing film techniques including animation and pixilation in the 20th century—he died in 1987. The Canadian artist's many accolades include a 1952 Oscar for Best Documentary for his abstract short film Neighbours (watch the whole thing here). Later in life, McLaren became interested in ballet, and made a number of dance films including his renowned 1968 Pas de deux.
NBoC's new work, titled Frame by Frame, will run June 1-10 in Toronto. The ballet combines vignettes of McLaren's life with movement quotes from his films and real time recreations of his technological advances. It was created in collaboration by NBoC principal dancer and choreographic associate Guillaume Côté and film and stage director Robert Lepage, who is making his NBoC debut. Pointe touched base with Côté on how this interdisciplinary project came together.
Where did the initial spark for this idea come from?
Robert and I have been wanting to work together for years. I approached him about doing a different project a long time ago, and he said "well, maybe that's not the correct project." He came to me about four years after that and said "I think I finally have something I'd like to work on with you," so then I approached the National Ballet.
Were you familiar with McLaren's work before this project?
I wasn't. Robert had just worked on a big McLaren documentary, and he got me to come see it and I realized that it was all about movement, and that this animator was basically a choreographer himself, a choreographer of space and time. There was all this material to work with and he'd made a number of iconic dance films, so it seemed like a no brainer. So I started my research and kept finding out more surprising fun facts about McLaren's passion for dance, like that he met Guy Glover, the man that he was in a relationship with for 50 years or so, in the audience at Covent Garden while watching a ballet. Guy was a curator of a dance festival in Canada.

What was the research process like?
Robert had just finished his documentary and has a really deep understanding of this kind of Canadian culture. He'd already gotten incredible footage from the National Film Board of Canada of McLaren behind-the-scenes. I watched a tremendous amount of film, and I read a lot about him and his collaborators, and even met a few who are still alive. The research was truly enriching, because I realized how wonderful of a person he was as well, which dictates how we share his personal life onstage.
What was the timeline of the project?
We had our first workshop four years ago. Since then we've been doing five-day workshops once a year in Robert's studio, Ex Machina, where he has a multi media team. They would put together projections and props for us to experiment with. Robert would give me some homework, and I'd take it on myself to create some impressionist sections. Sometimes we decided that they were great, and sometimes we decided that they weren't. It was this really collaborative way of getting things started because I was able to present dance first, and then we were able to add technology to it, as opposed to the technology taking over and stealing from the dance.

How does the piece balance a narrative retelling of McLaren's life with reproductions of his works?
I would say that the vignettes of his life are one third, and then the technologies that he pioneered and making abstract dance interpretations based on those technologies like stop motion or body painting and body projection are the second third. And then the last third is basically just direct quotes from his films and bringing them back to life. Like with Pas de deux, the effects in that film took him months to make, but now thanks to technology we can duplicate it live. It's not a story ballet per say, but there is a story from beginning to end.
What was the process like of taking movement quotes from McLaren's films?

GitHub is opening up its developer program to developers who do not have paid accounts.
The popular code-sharing service is looking to attract the open source community with the move. "That means if your free account was holding you back, you can join the program no matter which stage of development you're in,” said Jared Jones, GitHub Developer Program manager.
Launched in 2014, the GitHub Developer Program has featured a community of 17,000 programmers primarily developing software by using the GitHub API. Opening access to developers without paid accounts could dramatically expand that membership number, GitHub’s Joe Wadcan, head of business development, acknowledged.
The intent of the program is to encourage developers to integrate with GitHub and improve developer workflow, Wadcan said. Participants receive advance notice on API changes and are invited to events. The program also provides services such as licenses to build and test applications against the GitHub Enterprise iteration of the platform.
Along with expanding access to the program, GitHub is introducing participation levels, all of which are accessible free of charge. The first level, for organizations or member applications with one to 499 users, provides tools to learn about GitHub’s API and access the service’s integrator community. ("Member applications" refers to applications built by individual users who are not part of a large team or organization.)
Level 2 is for organizations with 500 to 999 persons or member applications with that amount. It offers all the benefits of Level 1 plus GitHub.com credits and network discounts.
Level 3 is for organizations or member applications with 1,000 or more users, and features all the benefits of the first two levels plus member spotlights, including retweets or preferred placement on GitHub digital platforms. Consulting services for scaling also are featured as part of the third level.

YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) — Armenia's government and the country's opposition are taking part in events to mark the massacre of 1.5 million Armenians a century ago by Ottoman Turks.
Tuesday's commemoration of the massacre that began 103 years ago —viewed by Armenians and many historians as genocide — comes after the country's prime minister resigned in a surprise move following days of anti-government protests.
Armenia's acting prime minister and other officials laid flowers at a hilltop memorial complex in Armenia's capital Tuesday morning along with thousands of residents. Leaders of the opposition and their supporters were marching to the memorial later on Tuesday.
Turkey, the successor to the Ottoman Empire, vehemently denies that the massacre was genocide and insists it was part of the violence during World War I.

BOSTON (AP) — The Latest on sentencing in the 2012 meningitis outbreak (all times local):
12:20 a.m.
The pharmacist convicted in connection with a deadly meningitis outbreak has tearfully apologized to the victims for the pain and suffering they endured.
Glenn Chin sobbed as he struggled through his statement during his sentencing hearing in Boston's federal courthouse on Wednesday.
Chin said he has prayed every day for the people who were impacted by the outbreak. Chin says he understands that many of the victims will never forgive him, but said he will continue to pray that they will "find some sort of peace."
Chin was convicted in October of fraud and racketeering, but cleared of second-degree murder. Prosecutors are seeking 35 years behind bars, while the defense is urging the judge for a three-year sentence.

11:45 a.m.
Victims of the 2012 meningitis outbreak and their family members are describing the pain and suffering they experienced because of the contaminated drugs.
The victims spoke Wednesday during the sentencing hearing in federal court in Boston for pharmacist Glenn Chin, who was convicted of racketeering and mail fraud for his role in the nationwide outbreak.
The Massachusetts man was cleared in October of second-degree murder under federal racketeering law.
Colette Rybinski choked back tears as she described watching her 55-year-old husband deteriorate mentally and physically after being injected with a mold-tainted steroid.
She urged the judge to punish Chin severely, saying he ignored plenty of warning signs that the drugs were unsafe.
Prosecutors are seeking a 35-year-sentence for Chin. Chin's lawyers are asking for about three years behind bars.

12 a.m.
A Massachusetts pharmacist convicted of mail fraud and racketeering in connection with a deadly meningitis outbreak is set to be sentenced.
Prosecutors in Boston's federal court will ask a judge Wednesday to sentence Glenn Chin to 35 years in prison for his role in the 2012 outbreak that killed 76 people and sickened hundreds.
Chin was cleared in October of second-degree murder charges, but convicted on dozens of other counts. Chin ran the now-closed New England Compounding Center's clean rooms, where the drugs were made.
The outbreak was traced to mold-contaminated steroid injections.
Chin's attorneys are asking for about three years behind bars. They say there's no evidence Chin caused the drugs to become contaminated and have blamed the pharmacy's co-founder, Barry Cadden.
Cadden is serving a nine-year prison sentence.
BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romania's top court has told the president to fire the country's chief anti-corruption prosecutor, widely praised for her efforts to root out high-level graft, but a thorn in the side of some politicians.
The constitutional court ruled Wednesday in a 6-3 vote that there had been an institutional conflict after President Klaus Iohannis disagreed with the justice minister's assessment that National Anti-Corruption Directorate Chief Prosecutor Laura Codruta Kovesi should be dismissed on grounds of failing to do her job properly.
Kovesi's departure would be a blow to the agency, respected by ordinary Romanians, the EU and the U.S. The court will explain its ruling later.
Justice Minister Tudorel Toader praised the ruling saying Iohannis did not have "the legal ability to evaluate the professional and management competences of high-ranking prosecutors."
JERUSALEM (AP) — Rabbi Aharon Leib Shteinman, the spiritual leader of Israel's non-Hassidic ultra-Orthodox Jews of European descent, has died. He was 104.
Shteinman died on Tuesday from a heart attack after falling ill weeks ago.
Shteinman was one of Israel's most influential rabbis and a political kingmaker whose orders were strictly followed by his representatives in parliament.
Following the 2012 death of his predecessor, Rabbi Yosef Shalom Elyashiv, he was widely regarded as "Gadol Hador," or "leader of the generation." Hundreds of thousands are expected to attend his funeral in the central Israeli ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak.
Shteinman was known for his rabbinic scholarship, relatively pragmatic rulings and extremely modest lifestyle.
Israeli President Reuven Rivlin called him a leader who "carried on his shoulders the existential weight of the Jewish people."

STAMFORD, Conn. (CBSNewYork) – The sound of gunfire and someone shouting “Everybody down, everybody” shocked moviegoers sitting in the lobby of the Bow Tie Majestic 6 movie theaters Sunday night, but the incident appears to have been a juvenile prank.
Five children ranging in ages from 10 to 16 were arrested and face both criminal charges and potential school disciplinary action after police say they used toy cap guns to stage the mock attack in Stamford, reports CBS2’s Tony Aiello.
Police say three members of the group had noisy toy guns and fired them in the theater while shouting “everyone down” before fleeing the theater.
Officers responded to the scene as if it was an active shooter situation.
A person at the movie theater followed the youths outside and was able to tell police where to find the suspected pranksters who now face charges.
Several patrons in the theater later said the incident reminded them of the 2012 mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, where gunman James Eagan Holmes killed 12 people during a midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises film.

The first signal that Adam Silver was more enlightened than the average commissioner came just months into his reign when he broke ranks with other sports leagues by calling for the legalization of sports betting. Not only that, the NBA commissioner suggested later, but the league wouldn’t mind joining in the profits that nationwide legalized betting might bring. Bold stuff, considering the NBA had for decades been in lockstep with Major League Baseball and the NFL in the belief that sports betting could destroy their empires. While baseball is now coming in line with a new way of thinking, Roger Goodell notably continues to rant about the evils of sports betting. That Silver is not afraid to tackle social issues is also reflected in the decision to move this weekend’s All-Star Game out of Charlotte because of the North Carolina law limiting protections for lesbian, gay and transgender people. Agree with him or not, it’s hard to imagine the NFL taking such a stand – especially when it might lose some money because of it. Three years into his tenure, Silver is on a roll. The NBA Finals last year were the most watched in nearly 20 years, the league has a new national television deal that is ridiculously lucrative, and there is a new agreement with players that guarantees labor peace for at least six years. Owners are happily counting their growing profits. Players are ecstatic over contracts that could pay them more than $40 million a year. To top it off, Silver even managed – at least temporarily – to keep Knicks owner James Dolan from making even more of a fool of himself than he has already in his dustup with former player Charles Oakley. Good times indeed, as the best players in the league prepare to gather in New Orleans for the All-Star Game that was taken from Charlotte. There’s a lot to celebrate for both players and owners in a league that is not only healthy but thriving. Some of that came about because both players and owners realized only they can kill the golden goose that continues to provide well for both. The new labor agreement signed a few weeks ago ensures that players will continue to get about half of each team’s basketball revenue in salaries, while the owners will see their franchises go up in value. Assuming it runs for the full seven-year length, the NBA will go for at least 13 years without any real labor issues. Revenues keep going up, and both owners and players seem to be satisfied with their share of a pie that keeps getting bigger. Meanwhile, the NBA is not haunted by concussions like the NFL. It’s not tainted by steroids, like baseball. And the entertainment value on the court is at a level probably not seen since Magic Johnson and Larry Bird squared off against each other three decades ago. Yes, there are still issues to address. Officiating is one of them, in a league where it’s difficult to know just what a foul is despite efforts to be more transparent about calls late in games. Too many teams have no shot year after year at making the playoffs, which themselves have become somewhat predictable. Ticket prices are scary high, and it remains to be seen whether the $2.6 billion a year television package is sustainable in an era of cord cutting. It’s also hard to give Silver a pat on the back for changing the name of the development league to the NBA Gatorade League and for allowing ads to creep onto uniform fronts. And while Silver wants to be out front on the sports betting issue, there is still no one outside of Nevada legally betting on NBA games and no indication that will happen anytime soon. But the NBA seems to be in good hands in a commissioner who learned a lot working under his predecessor, David Stern. That was evident on Monday when Silver moved quickly to get Oakley and Dolan in his office and, with an assist from Hall of Famer Michael Jordan, thrashed out a detente of sorts between the former player and the Knicks owner. As NBA problems go, the spat between Oakley and Dolan was more of a sideshow than anything. Both bear some blame for the altercation, though it was Dolan who escalated it by issuing a ban on Oakley attending Knicks games and suggesting that he had anger issues or alcohol problems. It could have been another distraction at the All-Star Game that no one wanted. But Silver moved quickly to make sure it wasn’t, just as he moved quickly to move the game from Charlotte when it became clear the law was not going to be changed. This weekend, the focus will be on the best players in the world, as it should always be. But forgive the commissioner if he’s called to take a little bow, too. — Tim Dahlberg is a national sports columnist for The Associated Press.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on probes into possible contacts between Trump campaign associates and Russia (all times local):
8:35 p.m.
The Washington Post is reporting that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election is now examining whether President Donald Trump tried to obstruct justice.
Accusations of obstruction arose when last month when Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. Comey testified in a Senate hearing last week that he believed he was fired "because of the Russia investigation."
Comey also testified he had told Trump he was not under investigation.
The Post report Wednesday cites anonymous sources who were briefed on requests made by investigators.
Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Trump's personal lawyer, responded Wednesday evening to the Post report by saying, "The FBI leak of information regarding the president is outrageous, inexcusable and illegal."
___
4:15 p.m.
The special counsel appointed to investigate Russian influence in the 2016 presidential campaign has met with a Senate committee probing the same matter.
The leaders of the Senate intelligence committee say In a statement issued Wednesday that they "look forward to future engagements" with Robert Mueller.
North Carolina Republican Richard Burr and Virginia Democrat Mark Warner aren't providing any other details regarding the meeting.
It comes a day after lawmakers questioned Justice Department officials about the probe and Mueller's independence.
Those questions were prompted after a friend of President Donald Trump said the White House was considering firing Mueller.
But Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller last month, testified Tuesday he has seen no evidence of good cause to fire Mueller.
At 5 years old, Joseph Livingston faced a brutal third-degree burn. The cause: consumer fireworks.He was celebrating Labor Day in Columbia, Md., with his neighbors back in 2016.One of the neighbors was playing with fireworks when a sparkler went off, striking Joseph. He suffered first-, second- and third-degree burns on his legs.Now, at 7 years old, Joseph is still receiving treatments at Johns Hopkins' Pediatric Trauma and Burn Unit after suffering the consequences of consumer firework dangers.The National Fire Protection Association, a trade organization that advocates for fire safety, found that 12,900 people were treated at U.S. hospital emergency rooms for firework-related injuries last year. Children under the age of 15 accounted for more than a third of those injuries.Fireworks can reach temperatures nearly 2,000 degrees and sparklers can reach 1,200, according to the organization.To put that into perspective, water's boiling point is 212 degrees.More fires are reported on July 4 than any other day of the year and 50 percent of those are caused by fireworks, the organization found.It urges people to not use consumer fireworks.

The County Fire burning near Lake Berryessa has grown to 82,700 acres and is now threatening over 1,000 structures. So far, the fire is 25 percent contained.Over 1,000 firefighters are still battling the blaze that nearly doubled in size on Monday.Most of the action, today, will happen around the small town of Guinda, on State Highway 16, which lies near the eastern side of the fire."The fire laid down, last night," said Cal Fire spokesman Israel Pinzon. Crews worked all night building containment lines along the fire.The massive blaze was choking skies with ash and smoke, prompting some officials to cancel Fourth of July fireworks shows and urge people to stay indoors to protect themselves from the unhealthy air.At least 2,500 people have been told to evacuate as the so-called County Fire continues to spread, said Anthony Brown, a spokesman with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.Brown said the blaze started Saturday and is surging through rugged terrain northwest of Sacramento amid hot and dry weather. "The weather is better than what we had last weekend. But it's still hampering our efforts and it's an area of concern," he said.So far this year, wildfires have burned 4,200 square miles in the United States, according to the fire center. That's a bit below last year's acreage to date - which included the beginning of California's devastating fire season - but above the 10-year average of 3,600 square miles.Because of the Independence Day holiday, authorities are also concerned about the possibility of campfires or fireworks starting new fires because of the dry, hot conditions.Cal Fire officials say their goal is to have full containment of this fire by next Tuesday, July 10, 2018.Residences served by Highway 128, between Monticello Dam and Pleasant Valley Road.West of State Highway 16, to Berryessa Knoxville Road, South of Old County Road 40, and North of County Road 53North of Highway 128South of County Road 23East of Berryessa Knoxville RoadWest of County Road 89, South of the community of Esparto, however agricultural equipment will be permittedNorth of Quail Canyon RoadSouth of Highway 128East of the Blue Ridge mountainsWest of Pleasant Valley RoadEast of Capell Valley RoadNorth of State Highway 128 from Capell Valley Road, East to the Napa County lineNorth of State Highway 128 in Yolo County, not including the City of WintersSouth of County Road 23East of Berryessa Knoxville RodWest of County Road 89, South of the community of Esparto, however agricultural equipment will be permittedFor questions regarding Yolo County evacuations or advisories, please dial 2-1-1 For questions regarding Solano County evacuations or advisories please dial (707) 398-8261Evacuation center: Guinda Grange Hall in the Community of Guinda 16487 Forest Ave. Guinda, CA 95637Northbound County Road 87 from Highway 128, Berryessa Knoxville Road, from the Pope Creek Bridge to the Napa/Lake County line, Eastbound Highway 128 at Markley Resort, Westbound Highway 128 at Pleasant Valley Road, Pleasant Valley Road, South from Highway 128 remains open to serve traffic into Solano CountyCalifornia Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Cal OES, California Highway Patrol, California Conservation Corps, Yolo County OES, Yolo County Sheriff, Solano County Sheriff, Napa County Sheriff, PG&E, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation, Bureau of Land Management, United States Forest Service, and California National Guard.The fire sent smoke across the Bay Area , as far west as Petaluma and as far south as San Francisco and Redwood City, according to the National Weather Service in San Francisco.The Associated Press contributed to this story.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — Inbee Park's 12th U.S. Women's Open already stands out for a gloomy reason: the rain-soaked course at Shoal Creek.
The picturesque course in suburban Birmingham had been drenched by nearly five inches of rain this week as of Wednesday afternoon, with the effects of Subtropical Storm Alberto adding onto earlier rains.
"This is probably the wettest conditions I have ever seen in a U.S. Women's Open," said Park, a Korean who won in 2008 and 2013. "We just don't know what's going to happen.
"Coming into the U.S. Women's Open, I always try to play the ball with the mud or try to play with like a wet ground condition because we've never played lift, clean and place. We just play from wherever it is and however the condition is."
Practice rounds were canceled Tuesday and the course closed, other than some late-afternoon trips to the driving range. More rain followed overnight and into Wednesday on the eve of the major championship , when the course finally reopened by early afternoon in time for some of the 156 players to get in practice.
The field will be cut to the low 60 scorers and ties after two rounds.
John Bodenhamer, USGA's senior managing director, said officials didn't plan to use lift, clean and place for the first time in one of the organization's championships.
"It remains our intention to play 72 holes and play the ball as it lies," Bodenhamer said Wednesday.
The LPGA Tour's Kingsmill Championship two weeks ago was shortened to 54 holes because of rain. The field, which includes 10 past Open champions, arrived in Alabama hoping to avoid a similar fate.
Pernilla Lindberg won the year's first major at the ANA Inspiration, the 11th consecutive women's major with a different winner.
The LPGA Tour has not had a multiple winner through 13 tournaments this season.
Korean Sung Hyun Park won last year at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, by two strokes over amateur Hye-Jin Choi.
Some players, including Inbee Park, Karrie Webb and No. 3-ranked Lexi Thompson, got a full 18 holes in Monday.
Thompson said some parts of fairways were "a little muddy and a little patchy." After that experience, she was hoping to play under lift, clean and place rules.
"I think it will be a little unfair if they don't, but you never know," she said. "I mean if they don't, everybody has to play it down and it is what it is, but it's their choice. The rain has not helped that situation, so I guess come Thursday we'll see, though."
This will be the third USGA championship at Shoal Creek but the first Women's Open. Buddy Alexander won the 1986 U.S. Amateur and Cameron Peck won the 2008 U.S. Junior.
Shoal Creek also hosted the PGA Championship in 1984 and 1990, when the club drew criticism for not having black members. That led the PGA Tour to change its policy on going to courses that didn't allow minority members.
The Regions Tradition, a PGA Tour Champions major, was held at Shoal Creek from 2011-2015.
This time the primary concern is the weather and course conditions.
Webb, who won back-to-back championships in 2000 and 2001, is playing in her 23rd consecutive Women's Open. She got a special exemption from the USGA.
"It'll be the softest U.S. Open course I've played," Webb said.
The conditions could potentially help long hitters like Thompson and Sung Hyun Park. But distance, of course, isn't the only important factor.
"I think it could set up for anyone that's just hitting lots of fairways and greens," Webb said.
Some players were fine with the unscheduled downtime of canceled practice rounds. Two-time U.S. Women's Amateur champion Danielle Kang played only the back nine on Monday and her scheduled practice round for Wednesday was pushed back too late to get it in, barring an earlier slot opening.
A friend, PGA Tour player and Birmingham native Trey Mullinax, gave her a rundown of the course over the phone.
Otherwise, Kang took advantage of the free time by seeing the movie "Solo," then sleeping until 10 a.m. Wednesday, enjoying brunch and not sweating the minimal practice time at Shoal Creek.
"I feel more prepared than ever," Kang said. "That's why I think I'm so kind of relaxed about it."
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Thousands of Armenian-Americans took to the streets of Los Angeles on Tuesday to commemorate the deaths of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians under the Ottoman Empire a century ago.
The demonstrations came hours after Armenian Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan resigned following 10 days of large anti-government protests in that country.
Marchers in Los Angeles are demanding that the 1.5 million deaths starting in 1915 be recognized by Turkey as genocide. A separate protest was planned outside the Turkish Consulate in Los Angeles.
Although Armenians and many historians consider it to be genocide, Turkey — successor of the Ottoman Empire — contends those who died were victims of civil war and unrest.
Los Angeles demonstrators waving Armenian and American flags carried signs that read "1915 never again" and "Turkish denial must end."
"We're here to commemorate what happened and remember the victims but also to send a message to the Turkish government," said Dickran Khodanian, an organizer with the Armenian National Committee of America.
Marie Keshishian, an 18-year-old student at Glendale College, said all four of her great-great grandparents were killed in the genocide and that she was marching in their honor.
"I'm out here today to march for justice, to march for recognition, to march for the people — my ancestors, my great-great grandparents who lost their lives ... to hopefully get more people to recognize and accept that there was a genocide," Keshishian said.
Andrew Antaramian, a 32-year-old Pasadena attorney, said his ancestors were able to flee Armenia safely and that he joins in the marches every year.
"It's important to always commemorate what our ancestors have gone through because if this is not going to occur again, we have to remind the world what our people went through," he said.
Kim Kardashian West, one of the most famous Armenian-Americans in the U.S., tweeted an old photo of herself in Armenia and praised global demonstrations calling for the genocide to be recognized.
"It's so inspiring to see all Armenians united in peaceful protests making a difference," she said. "It's a historic day for Armenia."
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel says it is reopening its embassy in Jordan after the two countries put a monthslong diplomatic spat behind them.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said on Tuesday that there will be a "gradual reopening" of the embassy in Amman but that no ambassador has been appointed yet.
The embassy was closed after a shooting last summer there in which two Jordanians were killed. Israel's ambassador returned to Israel along with the guard involved in the shooting. The guard claimed self-defense and received a hero's welcome at home, angering Jordanians.
The incident ruptured relations between the countries which signed a peace agreement in 1994 and cooperate on security and other issues.
Israel has since reportedly expressed regret for the incident and offered compensation to the victims.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on House Republicans' vote to release a classified memo on the Russia investigation (all times local):
10:15 a.m.
House Speaker Paul Ryan is defending a vote by Republicans on the House intelligence committee to release a classified memo on the Russia investigation.
The memo purports to show improper use of surveillance by the FBI and the Justice Department in the Russia probe.
Ryan told reporters Tuesday that "there may have been malfeasance at the FBI by certain individuals." He said there should be "transparency" on the issue.
The committee voted to release the four-page memo on Monday. It could become public in the next few days.
The memo has become a political flashpoint, with President Donald Trump and many Republicans pushing for its release and suggesting that some in the Justice Department and FBI have conspired against the president.

Republicans on the House intelligence committee have voted to release a classified memo that purports to show improper use of surveillance by the FBI and the Justice Department in the Russia investigation.
The four-page memo Republicans voted to release Monday has become a political flashpoint, with President Donald Trump and many Republicans pushing for its release and suggesting that some in the Justice Department and FBI have conspired against the president.
The memo was written by Republicans on the committee, led by chairman Rep. Devin Nunes of California.
Republicans have said the memo reveals grave concerns about abuses of the government surveillance powers in the Russia investigation. Democrats have called it a selectively edited group of GOP talking points that attempt to distract from the committee's own investigation into Russian meddling.

In one move, Brian Cashman minimized all the questions about Aaron Boone’s lack of experience.
That doesn’t matter now. In landing Giancarlo Stanton, Cashman effectively turned his rookie skipper into a push-button manager. Or as close as it gets in this era of analytics and soft-love player communication, anyway.
Boone will still have to deal with certain lineup and rotation decisions. But for the most part, he now takes over a team that is World Series ready thanks to the generosity of its old shortstop, Derek Jeter. The funneling north of the NL MVP for Starlin Castro and a couple of low-level prospects by the Marlins’ new co-owner desperate to free up dough for his debt-ridden franchise may only the beginning of a talent pipeline reminiscent of the one that brought Roger Maris and others from the Kansas City Athletics in the early 1960s.
But regardless of who comes in the future, getting Stanton and his 59 homers is the move that should set up the Yanks to storm the American League.
Boone need only to run out his lineup every day and watch the balls fly.
Analytics? Put the binders aside. The only numbers Boone needs to heed now are 59, 52, 33, 25, and 21. Those were the 2017 home run totals for Stanton, Aaron Judge, Gary Sanchez, Didi Gregorius, and Brett Gardner. And they don’t even take in the numbers Greg Bird is expected to produce provided his repaired ankle and late-season progress continue on their current paths.
What pitcher in his right mind wants to face a lineup that reads Gardner, Judge, Sanchez, Stanton, Bird, Gregorius? There’s not a weak spot until it gets to the bottom three of Chase Headley, and Gleyber Torres, the super-rookie expected to replace Castro at second, and whoever takes Jacoby Ellsbury’s place if Cashman succeeds in unloading him during the Winter Meetings this week.
Stanton and Judge alone have gotten people talking about a new addition of the “M&M Boys” — Mantle and Maris — but the top of the 2018 lineup would spell out an entire acronym if not for want of a vowel or two.
MORE: Sweeny: Stanton-Judge Possibilities Are Endless — Just Ask Maris, Mantle Families
As with anything, there are concerns. The 28-year-old Stanton has endured several trips to the disabled list in his career. He missed 88 games in 2015 from swinging too hard at a pitch, and lost the last 17 games of 2014 when he took a pitch in the face. Other lengthy absences happened in 2011, ’12, and ’13.
But Stanton did play in all but three games last year. If his health holds, Boone’s biggest problem may involve when to rotate him between the outfield and DH.
Then there’s the strikeouts. He finished among the top 10 in three of his eight seasons. Last year’s 163 ranked seventh. And with Judge’s league-leading 208, that scares the dickens out of some folks.
It shouldn’t. Homers and strikeouts are the name of the game now. With everybody upper-cutting for the long ball, the “Golden Sombrero” has gone from shameful to merely an occupational hazard. For Boone’s purposes, it’s better to strike out than have a DP take his team out of a possible three-run shot.
Forget about hitting and running. No need to steal, not that that was a big part of the Yanks’ offensive philosophy to begin with. But station-to-station ball has never looked so good in the Bronx.
On the business end, picking up the remaining 10 years, $295 million will make it hard, but not impossible, to stay under baseball’s $197 million luxury tax threshold. No matter. Summoning the ghosts of Babe Ruth’s “Murderer’s Row” and the “M&M Boys” easily trumped any financial considerations.
In fact, it became a fine investment not only for the offense, but also for a rookie manager who doesn’t need a mountain of pre-game moves to clutter up his thinking.
For Boone, it at least starts with pushing buttons. Set that monstrous top six, fiddle with the bottom three, run them out there, and watch them destroy the ballpark.
Pitching? That’s a discussion for another day.

OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Stephen Curry will likely go from being the NBA's biggest bargain to signing the richest contract in the league at more than $200 million. And he looks forward to the nice payday.
Yet the two-time reigning MVP and new NBA Finals MVP Kevin Durant said Wednesday they would seriously consider less money to keep the core of the champion Golden State Warriors intact.
Two days after capturing the franchise's second title in three years against LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Warriors prepared to part ways for what will be a busy offseason for general manager Bob Myers and the front office.
Durant hinted he would opt out of a deal that pays him the maximum he can get in order to help Golden State's chances of re-signing Andre Iguodala or Shaun Livingston.

Every week, we feature an up-and-coming surfer who is celebrating some kind of accomplishment. Maybe it’s a contest win, scoring on an exotic surf trip, or even successfully shaping a surfboard, but what sometimes gets overlooked is spotlighting the day-in and day-out dedication and hard work that leads to these successes. Case in point: San Clemente goofy-footer Max Beach.
Lately, Max has been in Hawaii, charging the North Shore scoring rides he’ll probably never forget. The North Shore is more or less surfing’s proving ground. With waves like Pipeline, Sunset Beach and Waimea, the power of the breaks there is unrivaled, and learning to tame these beasts takes years of experience.
Rather than wait until he’s battling for rating points on the WSL’s Qualifying Series in a few years, Max has taken it upon himself to put in the time on “the rock” to better understand the waves and conditions. True to form, he notes that Pipeline has become his favorite wave in the world.
“There’s nothing better than getting barreled and having enough speed when you come out to do anything,” Max reveled.
Given Max’s passion and work ethic, don’t be surprised if you see more of his work on the North Shore in the years to come.

Building a slide deck, pitch, or presentation? Here are the big takeaways:
Amazon Key will now deliver packages into a customer's vehicle at no extra charge, saving them time and money.
Professionals can have packages delivered to their car in the office parking lot, which is more professional than fielding personal deliveries inside the office.
Amazon Prime members can now have their Amazon orders delivered directly into their car through Amazon Key, the company announced in a Tuesday press release.
Amazon Key was originally touted as the service for delivering packages directly into the home of the recipient. Now, however, the Amazon Key In-Car service will deliver packages into compatible vehicles as long as they are parked somewhere that is publicly accessible, like a work or home address, the press release said.
Amazon Key In-Car is now available in 37 US cities, and currently works with 2015 or newer Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Cadillac with OnStar; and 2015 or newer Volvo cars with Volvo On Call, according to an Amazon spokesperson.
SEE: Workplace safety policy (Tech Pro Research)
"To get started, customers download the Amazon Key App and then link their Amazon account with their connected car service account," the release said. "Once setup is complete and the delivery location has been registered, customers can shop on Amazon.com and select the "In-Car" delivery option at checkout."
Amazon customer Scott L. from Miami noted in the release that he setup the service with his OnStar-equipped car, only giving Amazon permission to unlock the trunk and re-lock the vehicle. And each time a delivery driver requests access to the customer's car, it's done through an encrypted authentication process, the release said. Once the driver is confirmed to be at the right place with the right package, the car is unlocked. "No special codes or keys are ever provided to delivery drivers," the release said.
On delivery day, customers must confirm they are parked within range of the delivery location and are then given a 4-hour window for when the delivery will take place.
Amazon Key In-Car is safer than having a package delivered to one's porch, as thefts of online purchases have skyrocketed. But, it's also less invasive than allowing someone into a home, as is the process with the traditional Amazon Key delivery service.
For professionals, Amazon Key In-Car can save time and provide piece of mind by having packaged delivered into a car parked in the office parking lot. It's also a lot more professional than having personal packages delivered to the office during the work day.
With Key and Key In-Car, Amazon is working to blend the digital transformation of e-commerce with the physical world. It's a small look at the future of the connected world and why people like Larry Dignan, of our sister site ZDNet, have called the company out as being one of the most innovative tech companies today.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — U.S. officials are taking steps to stem a surging backlog in asylum applications to prevent fraud and enable those genuinely fleeing persecution to settle here.
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said Wednesday that it will start reviewing more recent applications first and push those already waiting a long time toward the back of the line.
It aims to prevent immigrants from applying for asylum to bide their time and obtain work permits when they don't qualify for the protection.
Immigration attorneys said the move was absurd and would force those already waiting three or four years to wait even longer for their cases to be heard.
The agency has more than 300,000 pending asylum applications, compared with 16,000 in July 2012.
Former Member of Knesset Arieh Eldad has criticized the leftist Peace Now movement for criticizing the Keren Kayemet L'Yisrael-Jewish National Fund's recent advertisement for an employee who would take care of acquiring land from Arabs in Judea and Samaria who wanted to sell their property.
On Sunday, Peace Now said in Hebrew (with a variation on its English page) "It is very unfortunate that KKL-JNF has decided to return to the dubious and tricky realm of purchasing land from Palestinians in the territories. This is a black stain on the JNF's magnificent record ... The purchase of land for the settlements undermines the chances of reaching peace and a two-state solution and threatens the Zionist vision."
Noting the JNF's original goal of purchasing land for Jewish settlement, Professor Eldad said, "The Israeli left can oppose the establishment of settlements in Judea and Samaria. But to call the redemption of lands from Arabs and their allocation to the Jews a 'black stain' and a 'threat to the Zionist vision' is a disgrace to the intelligentsia. Hello! This is precisely the 'glorious record of the Jewish National Fund.' Learn history, you ignorant hypocrites."
Recording Academy President Neil Portnow is facing criticism for his comments after the 60th annual Grammy Awards ended with only two female winners on stage and lingering questions about the choice of performers.
Following the awards show Sunday, many music fans and critics questioned whether the Time's Up movement was just given lip service when the only woman nominated for album of the year, Lorde, didn't perform. Instead, multiple minutes on the telecast was given to male artists who weren't nominated, such as Sting and the band U2.
While the red carpet was filled with artists sporting white roses to symbolize support of gender equality, backstage after the show wrapped Portnow was questioned about Lorde's absence from the stage, as well as the fact that only two women were shown on TV accepting awards.
"It has to begin with women who have the creativity in their hearts and their souls, who want to be musicians, who want to be engineers, who want to be producers, who want to be part of the industry on an executive level, to step up," Portnow said backstage after the show. "Because I think they would be welcome. I don't have personal experience of those kind of brick walls that you face. It's us as an industry making a welcome mat very obvious — creating mentorships, creating opportunities for all people who want to be creative, and, really, paying it forward, and creating that next generation of artists who feel like they can do anything, say anything."
Criticism for Portnow's comments was swift. Grammy-winning singer Sheryl Crow tweeted Monday: "I wish the #Grammys would return to female/male categories. Who will young girls be inspired by to pick up a guitar and rock when most every category is filled with men? I'm not sure it is about women needing to "step up", (as said by the male in charge). #GrammysSoMale"
Actress Debra Messing joined in the criticism, writing on Twitter: "This is incredibly dismaying to say the least" in regards to Portnow's comments.
The Recording Academy did not immediately return an email seeking comment Monday.
There were no women nominated in the record of the year category and the only male to be nominated in the best pop solo performance, Ed Sheeran, won. Alessia Cara won best new artist and Rihanna also got to take the stage when she and Kendrick Lamar won best rap/sung performance for "LOYALTY."
As for why Lorde didn't get to perform solo, Portnow said, "We have a wealth of riches every year and it's hard to have a balanced show and have everybody involved. Every year's different. We can't have a performance from every nominee. We have over 80 categories. And so we have to realize that we've got to create something that has balance and so on and so forth, and what you saw was our best judgment on how to do that."
As for Lorde, she seemed to address the controversy when she tweeted Monday morning, "If you're debating whether or not I can murder a stage... come see it for urself."

NEW YORK (AP) — Luis Severino struck out 11 in seven overpowering innings, beating longtime Yankees nemesis Dallas Keuchel for the second time this year as New York topped the Houston Astros 5-3 on Wednesday night.
Gary Sanchez snapped an 0-for-19 slump with a two-run single and the Yankees took two of three from the reigning World Series champions this week to win the season series 5-2. Houston defeated New York in the 2017 AL Championship Series, with the home team winning all seven games.
If these budding rivals meet again this year, it will be in October.
Severino (8-1) allowed four hits, including Max Stassi’s two-run homer, and walked one in winning his sixth consecutive decision. The ace right-hander, who hasn’t lost since April 10 at Boston, threw a five-hitter with 10 strikeouts for his first career complete game in a 4-0 victory over Keuchel at Houston on May 2.
David Robertson struck out two in a scoreless eighth and Aroldis Chapman got three outs for his 12th save in 13 chances. Stassi, subbing for injured catcher Brian McCann, hit an RBI double with two outs in the ninth before Chapman fanned George Springer to end it.
After dominating the Yankees for years, Keuchel (3-7) dropped his third straight start against them — including the playoffs. The left-hander gave up four runs and seven hits in five-plus innings.
Keuchel entered 6-4 with a 1.82 ERA and two complete games in 10 outings against New York, including three postseason starts.
The 2015 AL Cy Young Award winner walked two batters in the first inning, and center fielder Jake Marisnick made a diving catch on a sacrifice fly by slumping slugger Giancarlo Stanton.
Sanchez rolled a two-run single through an open right side with two outs in the fifth to put the Yankees ahead 3-2.
Gleyber Torres doubled to start the sixth and scored from third on Didi Gregorius’ single through a drawn-in infield that chased Keuchel. Aaron Hicks looped an RBI double off Collin McHugh later in the inning that got past a diving Marwin Gonzalez in left field.
Severino retired his first 11 batters, striking out seven of his first nine, before AL MVP Jose Altuve bounced a single through a wide-open right side.
New York (35-17), which has won 17 of its last 21 at home, matched a season high at 18 games above .500. The Yankees are 14-4 against left-handed starters and have won 10 of their past 11 completed series.
TRAINER’S ROOM
Astros: Slumping SS Carlos Correa was back in the lineup after a night off, and Springer took his turn receiving a rest. Springer struck out as a pinch hitter with two on to end the seventh and stayed in the game to play center field. … OF Derek Fisher (gastrointestinal discomfort) had a scheduled day off on his rehab assignment at Triple-A Fresno, manager AJ Hinch said. … The team was awaiting an update on McCann (sore right knee) after he was examined by doctors in Houston.
Yankees: RHP Adam Warren, on the DL since April 21 with a back strain, threw 41 pitches over three scoreless innings in a rehab start for Double-A Trenton. He allowed one hit and struck out three. … 1B Greg Bird was rested, leaving Gregorius as the only left-handed batter in the starting lineup against Keuchel.
UP NEXT
Astros: Return home to face another 2017 playoff opponent in Boston. RHP Lance McCullers Jr. (6-3, 3.98 ERA) starts the opener of a four-game series Thursday night against LHP Drew Pomeranz (1-2, 6.75 ERA).
Yankees: An 11-game road trip that takes them to four cities, although they finish up in New York against the crosstown rival Mets at Citi Field. RHP Sonny Gray (3-4, 5.98 ERA) tries to rebound from his latest disappointing start Thursday night in Baltimore. RHP Andrew Cashner (2-6, 5.07 ERA) goes for the last-place Orioles.

WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) — Mathieu Perreault scored two goals and added an assist to help the Winnipeg Jets halt a three-game losing streak with a 5-1 victory over the Vancouver Canucks on Monday night.
The win was the Jets' seventh straight victory at home and they have points in their last 11 games (10-0-1) at Bell MTS Place.
The Canucks have lost three straight in regulation for the first time this season.
Dmitry Kulikov, Josh Morrissey and Nikolaj Ehlers also scored for Winnipeg (18-8-5). Ehlers' 14th of the season was on the power play and gave him goals in three straight games.
Brock Boeser scored his team-leading 16th goal for the Canucks. He also extended his goal-scoring streak to three games.
Connor Hellebuyck made 25 saves for Winnipeg.
Jacob Markstrom stopped 19 shots for Vancouver (14-13-4).
The teams were tied 1-1 after the first period and Winnipeg led 3-1 after two. Markstrom let in a surprising goal 88 seconds into the first, squeezing his pads on Kulikov's point shot, but the puck slid into the net behind him.
Boeser tied it up at 6:53 after Henrik Sedin took the puck around the back of Winnipeg's net and fed a pass to Boeser in the slot.
The Canucks outshot the Jets 10-4 in the opening frame.
Winnipeg carried a late man advantage into the second, but Markstrom made a quick save on Kyle Connor's deflection right in front of him and a glove grab on an Ehlers' shot to help kill the penalty.
Winnipeg got another power play at 2:55 when Sam Gagner was called for holding and Perreault fired in his goal from the slot exactly two minutes later.
The Jets capitalized on their next power play when, 37 seconds after Nic Dowd went off for hooking, Tyler Myers' blast produced a long rebound to Ehlers at the top of the circle that made it 3-1 at 14:09.
The Canucks' shot advantage after two periods was 17-15.
Morrissey scored his fourth goal of the season with a redirection on a 3-on-1 with Adam Lowry and Andrew Copp at 11:38. Christopher Tanev was the lone defender.
Perreault netted an unassisted goal with 44 seconds left. Vancouver was 0 for 2 on the power play and Winnipeg 1 for 3.
Notes: Winnipeg was without defenseman Dustin Byfuglien, who was put on injured reserve with a lower-body injury suffered in last Saturday's 4-3 overtime loss to Tampa Bay. Head coach Paul Maurice said he didn't expect him back on the ice until after Christmas. Rookie Tucker Poolman took his roster spot ... Vancouver was missing top-line forwards Bo Horvat (broken foot) and Sven Baertschi (fractured jaw).
UP NEXT:
Canucks: host Nashville on Wednesday night.
Jets: host Chicago on Thursday.
Colombia’s president Juan Manuel Santos says no Latin America country would accept any form of U.S. military intervention in Venezuela and that it should never even be considered.
Santos held a joint news conference Sunday in Cartagena with visiting U.S. Vice President Mike Pence.
President Donald Trump said Friday that he will not rule out the possible use of the U.S. military to help restore democracy to Venezuela.
Recalling more than a century of U.S. military action throughout Latin America, Santos said no Latin leader wants “that phantom” to reappear.
He said a return to democracy in Venezuela must be peaceful, calling America a “continent of peace…let us preserve it as such.”
Pence did not rule out using military force, but he did not directly talk about it either.
He said there are may options available to pressure the Maduro regime in Venezuela, including more economic and diplomatic pressure. He assured Santos and everyone that the U.S. will not stand by as Venezuela “crumbles” and slides into dictatorship.
He said a failed state in Venezuela endangers the entire continent. He said Trump sent him to Latin America to marshal and consolidate regional support for the need to help the Venezuelan people.
Earlier Sunday, CIA Director Mike Pompeo told Fox News Sunday that Trump talked about the possibility of military actionto “give the Venezuelan people hope and opportunity to create a situation where democracy can be restored.” Venezuela called Trump’s threat “reckless.”
Colombia is the first stop on Pence’s week-long trip to to Latin America, which includes visits to Argentina, Chile, and Panama.
Pence and Santos also discussed drug and cocaine trafficking and Colombia’s so-far successful peace agreement ending 50 years of war with FARC rebels.
In Chile, Pence will face questions over the U.S. withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, Chile’s U.S. ambassador Juan Gabriel Valdes told the VOA Spanish service. “With or without the U.S., we will continue working in the Asia Pacific to push for an agreement that results in clear rules for everyone,” Valdes said.
He added that his nation hopes the United States does not follow through on the threat to leave the Paris climate agreement because Chile believes that climate change is real.
U.S. trading partner Panama, home to the Panama Canal, established diplomatic ties with China in June, and Pence’s upcoming visit comes against the backdrop of a growing Chinese trade role in the region. [Read More]

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on the trade dispute between China and the U.S. and plans for both sides to impose tariffs on each other's exports (all times local):
4:15 a.m.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel says the European Union will make every effort to avoid a trade war with the United States, but Washington needs to join in that effort.
President Donald Trump's administration has imposed tariffs on EU steel and aluminum imports and is mulling whether to add tariffs on cars, trucks and auto parts.
Merkel told the German parliament Wednesday: "It is worth every effort to try to defuse this conflict so that it doesn't turn into a real war, but of course there are two sides to that." She added that the good functioning of the world economy depends on countries working together as partners.

U.S. authorities are allowing China's ZTE Corp. to resume some business with American companies, temporarily easing part of a ban imposed over the tech giant's exports to Iran and North Korea.
The Commerce Department's order this week follows a settlement under which ZTE agreed to pay a $1 billion fine, replace its executive team and hire U.S. compliance officers.
The order said ZTE will be allowed to conduct business with American companies to maintain existing telecom networks and mobile phones and to support security features. The suspension lasts through Aug. 1.
ZTE suspended most operations after it was banned in April from buying U.S. components and technology. The company had been paying American suppliers an estimated $1.8 billion annually.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — The Latest on the Alabama Senate race (all times local):
7:30 p.m.
Former professional basketball star Charles Barkley says Alabama voters must send Democrat Doug Jones to the Senate to assure the rest of the nation "we're not a bunch of damn idiots."
An Alabama native, Barkley says Republican Roy Moore would continue to embarrass a state that has a history of politicians garnering negative attention.
Barkley is speaking at Jones' final campaign rally before polls open Tuesday morning.
He took aim at Moore's top celebrity campaigner, Steve Bannon. President Donald Trump's former adviser was also in Alabama on Monday.
Barkley called Bannon a "white separatist nationalist" and said he and Moore are courting voters who hold Alabama back.
Barkley is from outside Birmingham. He has commented over the years on Alabama politics, periodically entertaining the idea of running for governor.

Former White House strategist Steve Bannon says Alabama's special election for a U.S. Senate seat is an "up-or-down vote between the Trump miracle and the nullification project."
Bannon is speaking at a campaign rally for Republican candidate Roy Moore on the night before the election.
He says, "This is greater than Judge Moore and even greater than the people of Alabama."
The decor at the "Drain the Swamp" rally in rural southeast Alabama features a plastic alligator and plants. Other conservative icons on the agenda included Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas and former sheriff David Clarke of Wisconsin.
Bannon's former boss, President Donald Trump, said in a robocall Monday to Alabama voters that he badly needs Moore's vote in the Senate.

2:10 p.m.
Republican Roy Moore is casting himself as a victim in the Alabama U.S. Senate race.
In a call to a conservative talk radio show in Montgomery on Monday, Moore took aim at a political group called Highway 31, which has run ads hammering Moore over alleged sexual misconduct involving teen girls. The group hasn't disclosed its donors as it supports Democrat Doug Jones.
Moore says the ads have been "ugly." He laments the tone of the campaign and says he's been the recipient of vicious, unfounded attacks.
Still, Moore is expressing confidence in Tuesday's outcome.
He also claimed a potential surprising variable: support within the black community that leans overwhelmingly Democratic in Alabama.

1:25 p.m.
A House Democrat wants to know what preventative steps are being taken to protect teenage pages if Alabama elects Roy Moore.
Wisconsin Rep. Gwen Moore wrote to Senate Sergeant at Arms Frank Larkin saying she was urgently concerned that young men and women working as pages would need protection if Moore wins on Tuesday.
Moore faces several allegations of sexual misconduct, including the accusation that he molested a 14-year-old girl decades ago when he was in his 30s. He has denied the accusations.
Senate pages must be high school juniors, at least 16 years old, and attend school. Their duties include delivering legislation and correspondence at the Capitol. They attend classes in the morning.
Moore wrote that Congress has an obligation to keep the pages safe.

10:15 a.m.
Democratic candidate Doug Jones says Republican Roy Moore is hiding in the closing days of Alabama's U.S. Senate campaign.
Jones stopped by a breakfast spot in Birmingham early Monday to greet voters. So many media members were present that only a few other people could get inside.
Jones chided Republican Roy Moore for being out of sight ahead of Tuesday's election. He says Moore was out of state over the weekend.
Moore was in Montgomery on Sunday afternoon, but his campaign hasn't responded to questions about his whereabouts over the rest of the weekend.

Former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden have recorded calls urging turnout in Alabama's heated race for U.S. Senate.
A person familiar with the campaign said Monday that Obama had recorded a message in support of Democrat Doug Jones. Jones is attempting to become the first Alabama Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate in 25 years. He is locked in a heated battle with Republican Roy Moore.
Biden held a rally for Jones in Birmingham, Ala. earlier this year and has also recorded a call for Jones.
The Jones camp is sending out dozens of types of calls on the eve of the election to urge turnout. They include a news clip in which Republican Sen. Richard Shelby said that Alabama deserves better than Moore.
President Donald Trump has recorded a call urging people to vote for Moore.

8:45 a.m.
An official has quit the Republican National Committee over the GOP's support of Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, who faces accusations of sexual assault and harassment.
Joyce Simmons, the GOP national committeewoman from Nebraska, emailed the 168-member governing body Monday to inform them that she had tendered her resignation. She writes: "I strongly disagree with the recent RNC financial support directed to the Alabama Republican Party for use in the Roy Moore race."
Simmons adds that she wishes she could have continued her service "to the national Republican Party that I used to know well.'
The RNC had pulled support from Moore after the allegations surfaced against him last month. But the organization re-entered the race once President Donald Trump endorsed Moore, citing the need for a Republican in the seat.
___
3:35 a.m.
Republican Roy Moore and Democrat Doug Jones are making their final pushes ahead of Tuesday's special Senate election in Alabama.
Jones and Democrats are framing the election as a way for Alabama to reject its history of politicians with baggage that hampers the state.
Republicans say it is about keeping a conservative hold on Alabama and not giving Democrats any opportunity to derail President Donald Trump's agenda before the 2018 midterms.
In truth, the matchup is a mix of Alabama's history and the partisan divides plaguing Washington.
Jones says it would be disastrous to elect Moore after the former judge was accused of sexual misconduct with teenage girls. Moore denies the charges.
Moore and other Republicans say Jones would be a puppet of liberal Democratic leaders out of step with Alabama.

Last Monday in this space, we recommended fantasy baseball team owners drop catcher/first baseman Alex Avila after his trade from the Detroit Tigers to the Chicago Cubs. Then, the defending World Series champions suddenly lose their top catcher to an injury a few days later, and Avila suddenly has fantasy relevancy once again. It’s a tough world to stay on top of for six months straight, isn’t it?
The Avila example above is an extreme case, but it’s not just injuries and trades you have to keep an eye on at this point in the season if you want to win your league. The time is drawing near when a lot of MLB teams that don’t have postseason aspirations in 2017 are going to be bringing up rookie players for a quick look so they know what they have for 2018.
How can this affect your team? You could have a productive player in your lineup that is suddenly displaced because of a rookie promotion. We see this happen every season in fantasy baseball, because for teams with no shot at the Fall Classic, it’s more important to see what the rookie has to offer than it is for the club to win meaningless games with fringe veterans—even if those vets are producing for your fantasy team.
Players to Get Onto Your Roster Now
1. Hyun-Jin Ryu, SP, Los Angeles Dodgers: Of course, any Dodgers regular you can add to your roster probably will help you win the league title. But Ryu looks like he’s finally healthy now after missing the entire 2015 season and most of 2016 with an injury. He is striking out batters at a career-high rate (8.8 strikeouts per nine innings pitched), and since the All-Star break, Ryu has a 1.88 ERA.
2. Eddie Rosario, OF, Minnesota Twins: He’s not a rookie, but he has put together a nice season very quietly. If you need OF help, Rosario could be your guy. At age 25, he’s having his best season. Through 106 games, he’s hit 16 home runs, driven in 46 runs and hitting .293 overall. Those are solid numbers for a fifth OF on your roster. He currently is hitting .311 in the second half.
3. Tim Beckham, 2B/SS, Baltimore Orioles: The word is that he will only be starting until the Os regular shortstop returns from a wrist injury, but we’re not buying that. First off, wrist injuries are notoriously hard to recover from, and Beckham is currently hitting .531 with a 1.488 OPS since Baltimore traded for him. The Orioles would be stupid to take him out of the lineup. Pick him up if you can and never fear.
4. Edwin Jackson, SP, Washington Nationals: Bear with us here. Since joining the Nats, the 33-year-old journeyman has three wins and a 3.30 ERA in five starts. Washington has a good lineup behind him, and Jackson is experienced enough to not get into too much trouble. If you need wins, he could help your team. Also, Jackson’s 7.5 Ks/9 IP rate with the Nationals isn’t going to hurt you, nor will his 1.067 WHIP with the team, either.
Players to Sit/Drop This Week
1. Bud Norris, RP, Los Angeles Angels: On May 1, we recommended picking him up for some cheap saves. Eighteen of those cheap saves later, Norris has reverted to the mediocre pitcher he has been throughout his career, and he’s no longer closing games for the Halos after two big blown chances in a row. With an 11.2 Ks/9 IP rate, he still could work his way back into the closer spot, but we doubt it. Let him go.
2. Johnny Cueto, SP, San Francisco Giants: A month after hitting the disabled list, Cueto barely is throwing the ball right now, reportedly. If he was healthier, the Giants probably would have traded him by now. You can drop him and approach with caution next year in the draft after his disappointing 31-year-old season (4.59 ERA, 1.401 WHIP).
3. Jonathan Villar, UTL, Milwaukee Brewers: He’s been a one-trick pony this year with 21 steals and a .222 average, and now Villar will be out of a job soon thanks to the Brewers’ acquisition of Neil Walker via trade with the New York Mets on Saturday. This was a disappointing campaign after he stole 62 bases last year while hitting .285 overall.
4. Troy Tulowitzki, SS, Toronto Blue Jays: He will be 33 this October, and this could be the end for the five-time All-Star selection. Since being traded from Colorado to Toronto in 2015, he’s been extremely mediocre. He is out for the year now with an ankle injury, and that might help the Blue Jays since his bat (.678 OPS in 66 games) hasn’t been very good. You may want to avoid him in next year’s draft, sadly.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (WFAN) — By winning the PGA Championship — and his first major in the process — Justin Thomas has finally emerged from the long shadow cast by his buddy Jordan Spieth.
Thomas, a 24-year-old from Louisville, Kentucky, is only three months older than Spieth. They grew up playing junior tournaments together, competing against each other. They’re the best of friends, often vacationing together and practicing together.
But it was Spieth who broke out first, winning the 2015 Masters and U.S. Open titles. He just missed getting into a playoff by one shot at the Open Championship that year and was runner-up at that year’s PGA Championship.

Fast forward to 2017. Thomas won the SBS Tournament of Champions and then the Sony Open in Hawaii after shooting an opening-round, 11-under-par 59. In June, Thomas set a new U.S. Open scoring record relative to par, torching Erin Hills with a third-round 63. On the longest course in U.S. Open history, Thomas crushed a 3-wood from 310 yards on the 667-yard 18th and then drained an eight-foot eagle putt.
He was primed to win a major title and admitted there was definitely more than a sense of frustration watching Spieth have all of his success.
“Frustration isn’t probably the right word,” Thomas said. “Jealousy definitely is (laughter). I mean, there’s no reason to hide it. I would say anybody, they are jealous that I won. I was jealous that Sergio won; that Brooks won; that Jordan won. I wanted to be doing that and I wasn’t.”
With Spieth winning the Open Championship in dramatic fashion three weeks ago, which led to him garnering most of the attention early during PGA Championship week as he was asked non-stop about trying to win a career grand slam, Thomas flew under the radar, something that proved to be helpful.
“It was fine. It’s one of those things that it may get to some people or me a little bit,” Thomas said, “but at the end of the day, it is what it is. We’re just trying to play golf and play as well as we can.
“I just had an unbelievable calmness throughout the week, throughout the day…I had just the most comforting easy going (feeling). I truly felt like I was going to win,” Thomas added. “I remember my girlfriend was supposed to fly out at about 7 p.m. and I was like, ‘You need to change your flight to later, because I don’t know, I just feel like I don’t want you to miss this. I feel like I’m going to get it done.’”
And get it done, he did, in dramatic fashion.
Thomas’ birdie putt on the 10th sat on the lip of the cup for at least 10 seconds before dropping in. How that happened will forever remain a mystery. It was as if Thomas was destined to win and an unnatural force blew the ball in. Thomas then chipped in for birdie from 40 feet on 13 and followed up a gorgeous tee-shot on the par-3 17th with a 15-foot birdie putt.
Thomas stayed sharp and patient while the other dropped back.
And though Spieth never put himself in contention at Quail Hollow to complete the career grand slam — he finished in a tie for 28th — he hung around to watch Thomas and was one of the first guys to congratulate his buddy after it was over.
Expect Thomas to be the guy casting shadows moving forward.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Dutch bank ABN Amro says its underlying net profit, which strips out exceptional items, rose 23 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 333 million euros ($351 million).
The bank, which has been restructured and re-privatized following its bailout by the Dutch government in 2008 during the global financial crisis, said Wednesday that operating income for the fourth quarter rose 7 percent to 2.2 billion euros ($2.3 billion).
CEO Kees van Dijkhuizen says that in the last quarter the bank "achieved loan growth in all of our major loan books: we were the number one provider of new mortgages in the Netherlands for the second consecutive year."
A popular Berkeley restaurant says it does not support the actions of those in Charlottesville. Top Dog posted a sign with its views after a flurry of social media posts suggesting a man at the rally worked at Top Dog.Employees at Top Dog on Durant Avenue said they had no comment about a now former employee who may have been in Charlottesville."Different people were releasing the people's names and looking at their faces and trying to see okay where are they from and everything and someone said, 'Oh, he works here in Berkeley,'" said U.C. Berkeley student Kendall O.A sign on the restaurant's door says "Effective Saturday 12th August, Cole White no longer works at Top Dog. The actions of those in Charlottesville are not supported by Top Dog. We believe in individual freedom and voluntary association for everyone."Several U.C. Berkeley students stopped by the restaurant to take pictures of the sign."I feel that it's good that Top Dog is taking a stand against this kind of stuff," said U.C. Berkley student Ansel Deng.Many were horrified by the violence in Charlottesville."It's crazy it's 2017 and we still have people who are just so backwards who just can't seem to wrap their heads around inclusivity," said Deng."It's horrific, it's just really horrific," said U.C. Berkeley Alumna Havah Loehrer.But, Loehrer questioned the response on social media as people attempt to identify those in the crowd."It's a reaction that's just full of hate and anger and that just begets more hate and anger," said Loehrer.
STOCKHOLM--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr 23, 2018--Snow Software, the global leader in Software Asset Management (SAM) and Cloud Spend Management solutions, today announced the launch of Snow for Cloud and enhancements in Snow’s Oracle Management Option and Snow for ITSM.
Snow for Cloud
Snow for Cloud provides IT leaders with the next evolution of transparent, actionable views of their Software as a Service (SaaS) environment so they can easily assess and manage cloud usage and spend. It provides them insight to discover, make an inventory of and track consumption of more than 1,000 SaaS applications.
This deep analytical insight enables IT leaders to quickly and accurately identify overspend from duplicate, unused or underutilized SaaS subscriptions. Snow for Cloud also automates manual access requests and provisioning processes that are often costly and inefficient.
"Many organizations have gone beyond cloud-first and are now cloud only. Cloud computing has become the new normal." said Peter Björkman, CTO at Snow Software. "Business units can now deploy SaaS solutions without the involvement of IT. This leaves IT without visibility or control of their SaaS environment and uncertainty as to what is being used, where and by whom. This is creating a Disruption Gap, a gulf between what IT understands about technology usage and what is actually occurring.”
Björkman adds, “Snow empowers IT leaders to identify wasted cloud spend, optimize SaaS applications and accurately manage cloud costs. This insight enables them to become enablers of business goals and the go-to for digital transformation initiatives, essential if they are to succeed in the digital era.”
Snow Oracle Management Option and Snow for IT Service Management (ITSM)
Snow also announces enhancements to Snow’s Oracle Management Option and Snow for ITSM. Oracle Management Option provides CIOs and IT leaders with a complete overview of Oracle databases deployed in their environments. With visibility into data risk, IT leaders have a greater understanding of what platform Oracle is deployed into, whether physical or virtualized, or in a SaaS or IaaS environment.
Snow for ITSM supports a number of ITSM platforms with up-to-date asset information, software and users, improving CMDB data accuracy. Snow’s automatic identification and normalization of software and consolidation from multiple data sources will improve the efficiency of Help Desk operations.
Peter Björkman concluded, “The Software Asset Management market is evolving, which we feel is indicated by Gartner's inaugural 2018 Magic Quadrant for Software Asset Management Tools1 where Snow Software was positioned in the leaders quadrant. From our perspective, by addressing the complexities of cloud asset management, with support across more applications than anyone else, Snow Software continues to demonstrate why it is leading the SAM industry today.”

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A UPS employee opened fire at a San Francisco package delivery facility on Wednesday, killing three employees and then himself as officers closed in, police and the company said.
San Francisco assistant police chief Toney Chaplin said at a news conference that two others were wounded in the shooting that prompted a massive police response in an industrial neighborhood near downtown.
Police have not determined a motive. Chaplin said that the shooter was armed with an assault pistol and put the weapon to his head and pulled the trigger when police found him.
A UPS statement said the shooter and all the victims were employees. Spokesman Steve Gaut told The Associated Press that the gunman opened fire inside the facility before the drivers were sent out for their daily deliveries.
Neighbors said they heard up to eight rapid gunshots.
“It was like tat, tat, tat, tat, tat, tat, tat,” said Raymond Deng, who lives across the street from the warehouse.
After the gunfire, auto shop owner Robert Kim said he saw “a mob of UPS drivers” running down the street screaming “shooter, shooter.”
Deng, 30, a data scientist for a start-up company, also saw workers fleeing and another group of about 10 who gathered on the roof and held their hands up as police arrived.
“I saw police officers go up from the ramp and then storm the buildings,” he said. “It’s crazy.”
Police responding to the facility in the Potrero Hill area on the city’s eastern edge encountered wounded victims and pulled them to safety. Then they found the gunman, who killed himself.
Investigators recovered two firearms from the scene.
Uniformed UPS employees were later led out in a line by officers next to a highway. They walked away calmly with emergency vehicles nearby and gathered nearby outside a restaurant.
It came the same day a gunman opened fire on Republican lawmakers at a congressional baseball practice, wounding U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana and several others.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Police say two men have been arrested for their role in a violent altercation outside the Turkish ambassador's residence during a visit to Washington by Turkey's president last month.
The Metropolitan Police Department said in a brief statement that Sinan Narin had been arrested in Virginia on an aggravated assault charge.
It said Eyup Yildirim had been arrested in New Jersey on charges of assault with significant bodily injury and aggravated assault.
The department released no further details about the suspects but said additional information would be available Wednesday.
U.S. officials had strongly criticized the Turkish government after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's security forces pushed past police and violently broke up a protest outside the residence on May 16.

It was all right there in front of them. With a 98-94 victory in Game 5 on Thursday, the Rockets captured a 3-2 lead over the defending champs in the Western Conference finals. The Warriors were vulnerable, on the brink of elimination for the first time since adding Kevin Durant in the summer of 2016.
Then, it all disappeared. The Warriors used one of their patented third-quarter explosions to run over the Rockets on Monday night, winning Game 7 and finally removing Mike D'Antoni's team from their path to the NBA title. Golden State deserves credit for fighting off Houston, and yet, it felt like this series came down to what could have been for the Rockets more than what did happen for the Warriors.
Heading into the offseason after a disappointing finish, the Rockets are left with a few "what if" questions to ponder...
What if Chris Paul didn't go down with an injury?
This is the big one. Paul fell awkwardly late in Game 5 with a strained right hamstring and was physically unable to transition back to defense. That's the reason why Draymond Green still felt confident the Warriors would return to the NBA Finals despite the 3-2 deficit — the loss of Paul in the final two games of the series was simply too much to overcome.
Rockets with Paul vs. Warriors Off Rtg Def Rtg Asst/TO TS % Paul ON (184 minutes) 102.2 110.6 1.20 55.0 Paul OFF (152 minutes) 98.0 113.4 0.91 51.3
"It sucks because you know you could win this series if we just had one more playmaker," Rockets guard Eric Gordon said after the Game 7 loss. "If we had Chris, if he was out there, we'd have been playing on Thursday [in Game 1 of the NBA Finals]. It's just tough."
Paul is an All-NBA performer whose poise and production can't be replicated, especially not against this opponent. James Harden couldn't handle the offensive burden without Paul, and talent eventually won out.
Story Continues
What if the Rockets hit a few more 3-pointers — or any 3-pointers?
The Rockets' shooting woes are tied to Paul's absence, as the veteran likely would have been able to settle down the offense with his own scoring and mix in a few midrange jumpers to add some variation. Even so, Houston missed an NBA playoff record 27 3-point attempts in a row (several of them wide open), finishing 7-of-44 (15.9 percent) from beyond the arc in Game 7.
Here's what 27 consecutive missed threes looks like.

Over the course of that 0-for-27 drought, the Warriors outscored the Rockets, 59-34, and went 13-of-23 from 3-point range. Houston missed from the top of the key, wings and corners with players like Harden (2-of-13), Gordon (2-of-12) and Trevor Ariza (0-of-9) all clanking makeable shots. Just bring those percentages up from awful to below average, and it's not hard to envision a close fourth quarter.
What are the odds of a trigger-happy team like the Rockets missing that many shots? According to calculations done by FiveThirtyEight's Chris Herring, 1-in-72,000.
What if this was the Rockets' best shot at a title?
It's possible the Rockets come back from this devastating loss and reach the Western Conference finals next season. General manager Daryl Morey could make minor tweaks or chase a big free agent to improve the roster. If nothing else, Houston proved Golden State is beatable.
But championship windows can close quickly. D'Antoni knows this better than most — his "Seven Seconds or Less" Suns never broke through to the NBA Finals.
Paul just turned 33 this month, and injuries can add up for a player at his size. Harden did all he could given his workload, but questions remain about his decision-making and ability to lead a team in key moments. Role players could see regressions.
The Rockets had the Warriors on the ropes, but they couldn't land a knockout blow. There are no guarantees they find their way back into the ring.

ERIN, Wis. (AP) — Determined to avoid the embarrassing rules mess from a year ago, the USGA is shaking up the way it officiates the U.S. Open at Erin Hills.
It pledged to respond quicker and not wait to make a ruling.
“I think last year there were two things we fell short on – it took too long to make the ruling and it left uncertainty with the competition,” said John Bodenhamer, the USGA’s managing director of rules and competition. “I think should a similar circumstance happen, I think we are poised to move quickly.”
The U.S. Open, as well as the USGA’s other biggest events, will no longer have referees who walk with each group, a practice that dates to 1991. Instead, officials will be stationed at various spots on each hole around the course.
The biggest advancement is having four video monitor stations, along with the use of tablets, that will allow officials to review any rules discrepancies on the course to reach conclusions immediately.
That might have made it a lot easier on Dustin Johnson – and everyone else – last year at Oakmont.
Johnson’s golf ball moved slightly as he stepped in for a 3-foot par putt on the fifth hole. He didn’t think he caused it to move, called in the walking referee and no penalty was assessed. But when the USGA saw video, officials thought there might be a penalty.
They told Johnson when he was on the 12th tee, saying he might be penalized and they could review it after the round. That would have been fine except that it was the final round. Johnson played the last seven holes not knowing if he would be penalized, and thus not knowing the score.
It was a major gaffe, saved only by Johnson playing so well that he had a four-shot lead when he birdied the final hole to win the U.S. Open. After meeting with officials, he was given a one-shot penalty that affected only the margin of victory, not the name on the trophy.
The USGA has a five-member rules committee led by Thomas Pagel, the senior director of rules. Pagel will be the chief referee for the U.S. Open, who can make immediate decisions that would stand.
A repeat of the Johnson incident is unlikely this year, and not just because the greens at Erin Hills are nowhere near as fast as Oakmont’s putting surfaces. The USGA introduced a local rule last year that if a golf ball or marker moves accidentally, the player puts it back without penalty.
Having video more readily available for review should help avoid uncertainty.
Bodenhamer said the rules committee – not always the player, in some cases – would be able to look at the video and quickly decide whether it’s a penalty.
It was the most significant change for a U.S. Open that is desperate to have a smooth tournament. The previous year at Chambers Bay, the grass on the greens was starting to die before the U.S. Open began and at times on the weekend, players were putting through what amounted to matted dirt.
Jordan Spieth won when Johnson, needing a 12-foot eagle putt to win, three-putted for par to finish second. He missed a 4-foot birdie putt on the bumpy green.
Part of that could be attributed to weather in the Pacific Northwest that week.
As for Oakmont a year ago, that was a breakdown in communication and delivering the ruling at the right time.
“We not only learned from it, but we made changes,” USGA executive director Mike Davis said. “And I think that’s the way you have to approach anything that doesn’t go right: ‘How can we make it better? How can we make sure it doesn’t happen in the future?'”

NEW YORK (AP) — Social media is a daily way of life for many Americans.
Nearly half of Americans who use the internet say they use Facebook at least several times a day, making it easily the most popular social media site. And Facebook-owned Instagram comes in No. 2.
So whether you're reaching for your phone before getting out of bed in the morning, or logging on to procrastinate during work, chances are you see the little blue "F'' icon more often than you take a shower.
A new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that 12 percent of Americans who are online use Facebook "almost constantly," while 34 percent use it several times a day. About 15 percent use it once a day, and only 12 percent of Americans don't have a Facebook account at all.
More women than men check Facebook more than once a day — 57 percent of women compared to 36 percent of men, according to the poll. Younger people are on Facebook more than older people. About 62 percent of adults under 30 check the site several times a day or more, while only 30 percent of adults 60 or over do. About 54 percent of adults 30 to 44 check multiple times a day, as do 43 percent of adults aged 45 to 59.
Jim Mazzarese, 73, a retired airline manager from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, is one senior who checks Facebook on his phone several times a day when he gets notifications. He has a bit of a love-hate relationship with the site.
"It gets me crazy when I see opinions other than mine, it gets my blood pressure going up — but it's a lot of fun," he said. He appreciates how Facebook has let him connect with people from when he was growing up "100 years ago."
What about the other social media sites?
Seventeen percent of Americans say they check Instagram throughout the day, and 10 percent say that about Snapchat. For all of the attention that President Donald Trump gets for his tweets, only 7 percent of Americans say they use the micro-blogging site several times a day. Just 5 percent say they spend that much time on WhatsApp, and 4 percent say the same of Reddit.
Is it actually healthy to check in with Facebook so much?
In a blog post in December, Facebook acknowledged that users should be mindful of the issue. A study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology the same month found University of Michigan students randomly assigned to read Facebook for 10 minutes were in a worse mood at the end of the day than students assigned to post or talk to friends on the platform.
Meanwhile, a study that Facebook research director David Ginsberg conducted with a Carnegie Mellon professor showed that sending or receiving direct messages or posts and comments on one's timeline tends to boost psychological well-being.
Worldwide, Facebook has 1.4 billion daily active users out of 2.2 billion total, so most active Facebook users check in at least once a day.

FOREST PARK, Ohio (AP) — Police are investigating shots fired at two vehicles in a northern Cincinnati suburb.
Forest Park police say no injuries were reported, but two vehicles were shot at. Officers were first called to Hamilton Avenue just off Interstate 275 early Tuesday morning after a woman said a shot was fired at her from a car. A short time later, a tractor-trailer driver reported shots fired at his vehicle while on the interstate.
Police say both vehicles had dents consistent with being hit by bullets. They believe the vehicles were targeted randomly.
Police are asking for cooperation from business owners with security cameras in the area.

BERLIN (AP) — German police say they have arrested three suspects during raids against a group that is believed to have smuggled at least 160 migrants into Germany over recent months.
Federal police spokesman Christian Meinhold said raids were staged in four German states Wednesday. Two suspects were arrested in Berlin and a third in Bad Muskau, on the Polish border, and seven properties searched.
The suspects are believed to belong to a group that smuggled migrants from the Czech Republic and Poland, largely using trucks.
The alleged smuggling took place since August and an investigation was launched in the fall.
Germany saw around 186,000 asylum-seekers arrive last year. That's much lower than the previous two years, but officials say it's still too high and that's due in part to smugglers' activities.
Minister Ze'ev Elkin related to the six-month distancing order form the Knesset imposed by the Ethics Committee on MK Basel Ghattas (Arab Joint List).
"Unfortunately, the decision of the Committee is not enough and doesn't solve the absurd situation in which a sitting Knesset member is supporting terror.
"MK Ghattas continues to receive a salary every day at the taxpayer's expense and he is still eligible to vote and influence important decisions.
"The only ones who can stop this immediately are Lapid, Herzog, and Livni. I call on them to stop this disgrace and sign the petition that I put forward to immediately expel MK Ghattas. Everything depends on you," he said.
NEW YORK (AP) — The Latest on Ravi Ragbir, an immigrant activist facing deportation who was ordered freed from detention (all times local):
12:15 p.m.
An immigrant activist freed from detention by a judge's order says immigration officials are engaging in "psychological warfare" by targeting him and other activists for detention and deportation.
Ravi Ragbir (RAH'-vee RAHG'-beer) says U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is trying to send a message to the immigrant community by taking high-profile activists into custody.
ICE refutes that contention and says it doesn't target anyone "based on advocacy positions they hold or in retaliation for critical comments they make."
Ragbir was released from detention in New York on Monday following a judge's ruling. He had been detained since mid-January and has been fighting deportation.
He's trying to attend the State of the Union address in Washington on Tuesday, where immigration will almost certainly come up.
___
12:02 a.m.
A federal judge who ordered a detained immigration rights activist facing deportation to be immediately released is raising "grave concern" over the argument that he had been targeted because of his political activities.
U.S. District Judge Katherine B. Forrest ruled that Ravi Ragbir be freed after a hearing on Monday in Manhattan federal court. The activist had been detained since Jan. 11. He's been fighting deportation following a wire fraud conviction and is executive director a coalition of faith-based groups.
Concern over activism-based targeting by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement also has been expressed in recent weeks by immigrants and their advocates over Ragbir's and others' cases.
ICE says it doesn't target anyone "based on advocacy positions they hold or in retaliation for critical comments they make."

After her glorious Grammy sweep on Sunday night, Adele woke up to a #BoycottAdele hashtag, with many Beyoncé fans questioning her "unfair" win over their idol. But calls for a boycott are scarcely new for Adele. Last year, after she endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, Trump supporters launched a similar hashtag. Buffeted by the competitive politics of the right and left, the English singer will likely think longingly back to the uncomplicated very first #BoycottAdele hashtag that trended briefly in 2015 after the release of her hit single "Hello."
It had nothing to do with politics and everything to do with tea.
The millions of fans who have watched the music video of "Hello" know that a steaming cup of tea has a central role to play in providing succor to the singer's lovesick heart.
Artfully stained with sepia and loss, the retro video opens with a deeply depressed Adele walking into a shut-up house enrobed in dustcovers. Outside, it's wickedly cold and blustery. Inside (her broken heart) the temperature's pretty tundra-like too. So while she lavishly mourns the loss of her coffee-drinking lover in song, Adele does what the English do when things look bleak. She pops the kettle on. There's a delicately patterned china cup and saucer waiting to be filled. So far, so good.
Then, the singer does something absolutely shocking. She pours hot water into the cup and then pops in a tea bag. Instead of the other way around, of course. This casual switching of steps was an outrage and nothing short of tea treason. British twitter sputtered with indignation.
How reassuringly English. A country that has fought two opium wars with China to protect its precious tea supply takes the beverage very seriously.
Ask the man who is the au currant hero, George Orwell. He may have fought totalitarianism all his life, but when it came to making a pot of tea, it was his way or the highway. His popular essay, "A nice cup of tea," is an 11-point disquisition on how to achieve just that. Orwell would have been horrified by Adele's – and the modern streamlined style of – tea-making. Not merely by the presence of a teabag but by the absence of a teapot. "If the tea is not loose in the pot it never infuses properly," he declaimed. In order to get a good infusion, one "should take the teapot to the kettle, and not the other way about. The water should be actually boiling at the moment of impact, which means that one should keep it on the flame while one pours."
As for that other great anti-totalitarian Brit, John Lennon, he could imagine a world without heaven and religion, but not without tea – brewed the right way, of course. A few years ago, his widow, Yoko Ono, wrote a piece for The New York Times called "The Tea Maker," in which she affectionately recalled their midnight tea-making kitchen trysts. "Yoko, Yoko, you're supposed to first put the tea bags in, and then the hot water," John would admonish her. And so Ono allowed him to make the tea his way. But, for tea purists, there's an unfortunate twist to this story. As Ono tells it:
One night, however, John said: "I was talking to Aunt Mimi this afternoon and she says you are supposed to put the hot water in first. Then the tea bag. I could swear she taught me to put the tea bag in first, but ..." "So all this time, we were doing it wrong?" "Yeah ..." We both cracked up...
So Adele should take heart. She has the great Beatle on her side. But though once a committed tea drinker, Adele has given up her 10-cups-a-day habit. Not because of the tea trolls but because of the pounds she was putting on from the heavily sugared cups.
Meanwhile, her "Hello" video has launched a range of "Hello, it's tea" merchandise and several cheeky parodies, including changing the soulful line of Lionel Richie's 1983 hit, "Hello," to "Hello, is it tea you're looking for?" In another very funny send-up, an English radio presenter rewrote the lyrics to make tea the star. So instead of belting out "Hello from the other side," we have:
Where the hell's my cup of tea? My ginger nut needs dunking see Have you even turned the kettle on? I should have had it by now But all my biscuits are gone I love tea It's me and tea.
On Sunday night, after an awkward, overwrought but sincere-sounding acceptance speech in which she nervously lavished praise on Beyoncé, Adele accidentally broke her trophy in half. As if it were a ginger nut biscuit she was dying to dunk into a cup of tea. With all of those boycott hashtags, she could certainly do with a cuppa.

Arkansas is making preparations for a series of executions that, as of late morning Monday, it is legally barred from carrying out. The state's attorneys are fighting to persuade judges to allow the executions — and to make the decision quickly.
The state had scheduled eight men to die over the course of 11 days, because one of the drugs it planned to use in the executions expires at the end of April. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said it wasn't clear whether the state could acquire additional supplies of the sedative midazolam.
Two of the executions had been stayed individually before all eight of them were blocked by a state judge and a federal judge.
The state judge's decision, reached Friday, was based on how Arkansas acquired another drug — vecuronium bromide, which is used in anesthesia as well as executions. A pharmaceutical supplier alleges that the state bought the drug deceptively, actively misleading the seller about what it would be used for.
That decision "stirred a wave of consternation and threats on social media from state lawmakers and conservatives," member station KUAR noted on Saturday — because shortly before the decision, the judge was photographed protesting the death penalty at the gates of the Governor's Mansion.
The federal judge's decision on Saturday, meanwhile, was in response to a lawsuit on behalf of the inmates that argued an execution with midazolam would violate their rights. Midazolam has been used in a number of high-profile botched executions, including instances where inmates did not appear to be fully sedated when they received the painful second and third drugs in the cocktail. The suit argued there was an unacceptably high risk they would suffer during the executions.
The judge determined that their concerns were sufficient to halt the executions for the time being, to allow the issue to be considered by the courts.
Hutchinson and state Attorney General Leslie Rutledge have been pushing to carry out the executions anyway. But they are on a tight schedule: Executions were scheduled to begin Monday night, and if the legal proceedings take more than two weeks, the midazolam supply will have expired before any of the executions can take place.
The state has appealed both rulings and asked the higher courts to work quickly to review the decisions. The inmates on death row, meanwhile, have asked the courts to take the time and avoid a "rushed analysis."
Arkansas' attorney general also asked the state Supreme Court to reconsider the stay it granted one inmate, over questions about his mental health; the court rejected that request, keeping that stay in place, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports.
As the legal battle plays out, the state's execution facility is prepared for a rapid reversal of the decisions.
If the rulings are overturned by Monday night, the state will be prepared to execute at least one inmate, according to local TV station KATV.
KATV, citing anonymous officials, reports that death row inmate Don Davis has been transferred to the unit where the state's Department of Correction was preparing to carry out executions.
"Davis' exact schedule for the day is confidential but as part of the death protocol, he will be meeting with counsel and a spiritual adviser," KATV reports. "Authorities say a last meal has also been arranged."
Arkansas hasn't executed anybody for more than a decade, partly because of a series of legal challenges to the state's death penalty laws.

Law enforcement and intelligence agencies found that several of US President Donald Trump's associates, as well as several members of his campaign team, spoke numerous times with Russians prior to the November 2016 elections.
According to the New York Times, phone records and intercepted calls show Trump campaign officials and advisers repeatedly conversed with senior Russian government and intelligence officials. The conversations took place over a period of several months.
Four current and former US officials told the New York Times the communications were first discovered in the fall, around the same time as intelligence realized Russia posted disinformation to sabotage Hillary Clinton's campaign.
It is not clear what was discussed during the conversations, or if Trump was mentioned in them.
Authorities refused to identify which officials were involved, and were unable to find evidence connecting the phone calls to the cyber attack or foul play.
However, one of the officials in question is said to be Paul Manafort. Manafort served as Trump's campaign chairman for several months, and resigned after it became known that he had worked as a political consultant in both Russia and the Ukraine.
The FBI also investigated consultant Roger Stone and former foreign policy adviser Carter Page. All of these completely denied any and all accusations. As part of their Trump investigation campaign, the FBI has also also obtained bank records, travel documents, and conducted interviews.
Manafort said, "This is absurd. I have no idea what this is referring to. I have never knowingly spoken to Russian intelligence officers, and I have never been involved with anything to do with the Russian government or the Putin administration or any other issues under investigation today.
"It’s not like these people wear badges that say, 'I’m a Russian intelligence officer.'"
White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said no one in the Trump campaign had contact with Russia prior to the election and that "there is nothing that would conclude me [sic] that anything has changed in the meantime."
The calls in question are completely separate from the ones Trump's former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn reportedly had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.
Jewish groups in Britain said on Tuesday a meeting with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn over his handling of an ongoing anti-Semitism row within his party "was a disappointing missed opportunity", AFP reports.
The Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council (JLC) issued the rebuke after two hours of talks with Corbyn, who has been dogged for weeks by allegations that Labour has a growing anti-Semitism problem under his leadership.
Two Kenyan runners, both of them making their Boston Marathon debut, have won the prestigious race.
Edna Kiplagat, a Kenyan policewoman and two-time world champion marathoner, finished first in the women's race with a time of 2:21:52. Rose Chelimo, a Kenyan-born Bahraini runner, placed second.
Geoffrey Kirui, also of Kenya, won the mens' race at 2:09:37 — his first-ever marathon victory. He edged out Portland runner Galen Rupp by 21 seconds.
It was a big day for debut runners at Boston, according to Runner's World.
In the women's race, 25-year-old Jordan Hasay ran her first-ever marathon in 2:23:00 to place third. It was the fastest-ever debut by an American woman, Runner's World says.
And in the men's race, 26-year-old Suguru Osako of Japan — also competing in his first marathon — placed third with 2:10:28.
Meanwhile, competitors in the wheelchair race finished in world-best times, The Associated Press reports:
"Manuela Schar of Switzerland finished in 1 hour, 28 minutes, 17 seconds — shattering the world best by more than five minutes. Fellow Swiss Marcel Hug took the men's race in 1:18:04, also the fastest time ever. "The winners' times are considered a world best and not a world record. The straight-line Boston course doesn't qualify for world records because of the possibility of a supportive tailwind like the one on Monday."
The athletes had a tailwind of 13 mph, the AP reports.
JOHANNESBURG (AP) — It will be a first for Zimbabwe's voters: the name of Robert Mugabe, 94, won't be on the ballot when elections are held on July 30. But the military-backed system that kept the former leader in power for decades, and then pushed him out, is still in control.
That is the conundrum facing a southern African country anxious to shed its old image as an international pariah, and to draw the foreign aid and investment needed for an economic revival. The government promises a free and fair vote and the military, whose 2017 takeover led to Mugabe's resignation, says it won't stray from the barracks.
Some Zimbabweans, though, wonder how much things have really changed.
They ask whether the ruling ZANU-PF party and military would accept an opposition victory.
RALEIGH, N.C. (WNCN) – An old idea is gaining new interest in North Carolina’s General Assembly.
Lawmakers want to look at the feasibility of breaking up the state’s largest school districts.
It’s an idea that was floated almost decade ago in Wake County.
In 2009, then Wake County School Board member Chris Malone was in favor of breaking up the county’s school system.
Now, Malone is a state representative sponsoring a bill that would examine breaking up the state’s largest school systems.
Malone (R-Wake) said House Bill 704 would only study whether any school district is too large to be effective.
Malone said lawmakers are just in the exploratory stage.
Nearly a decade ago, Ron Margiotta was the chairman of the Wake School Board and advocated splitting the district.
He still likes the idea.
“It’s too difficult to accomplish anything and get things done with the monster bureaucracy in Wake County,” Margiotta said.
Realtors say people come to Wake County for the schools.
The Wake County system is 15th largest school district in the country and some say its size is an advantage.
Lawmakers say the proposed study committee will see if that’s the case and look at the various ways to divide school districts.
The bill would ask the study committee to determine if the public should be allowed to vote on breaking up school districts in a ballot referendum or if should occur another way.
PHOENIX (AP) — A national meeting of Southern Baptists will consider condemning the political movement known as the "alt-right" amid an uproar over the denomination's commitment to confronting prejudice.
Leaders of the faith group initially refused to take up a proposal that they repudiate the political group that emerged dramatically during the U.S. presidential election, mixing racism, white nationalism and populism. Barrett Duke, a Southern Baptist leader who led a committee that decided which resolutions should be considered for a vote, said the resolution as originally written contained inflammatory and broad language "potentially implicating" conservatives who do not support the "alt-right" movement.
But the decision caused a backlash online and at the gathering in Phoenix from Southern Baptists and other Christians, especially African-American evangelicals. The denomination has been striving to overcome its founding in the 19th century in defense of slaveholders. Thabiti Anyabwile, a black Southern Baptist pastor, tweeted that "any 'church' that cannot denounce white supremacy without hesitancy and equivocation is a dead, Jesus denying assembly. No 2 ways about it".
Southern Baptist leaders responded late Tuesday night with a dramatic call for attendees to return to the assembly hall, then announced they would take up the proposal after all on Wednesday. It was a highly unusual move for the denomination's tightly choreographed conventions, underscoring the sensitivity of the issue and the alarm among leaders that their initial rejection of the proposal would be viewed as an unwillingness to fight racism. In encouraging the meeting to reconsider, Steve Gaines, president of the Southern Baptist Convention, said he wanted to send the message that "we love everybody on this planet."
The initial proposed resolution came from a prominent black Southern Baptist pastor, the Rev. Dwight McKissic, who had submitted the suggested statement to Duke's committee before this week's gathering. When the proposal was not presented Tuesday, McKissic made a direct, unsuccessful plea for reconsideration from the floor of the Phoenix meeting. He called the "alt-right" a symptom of "social disease," ''deceptive" and "antithetical to what we believe." His resolution condemned Christians who attempted to use biblical teachings to justify white supremacy.
The new resolution that will be debated Wednesday states racism and white supremacy endure "in various white supremacist movements, sometimes known as 'white nationalism' or 'alt-right.'" Southern Baptists "decry every form of racism, including alt-right white supremacy as antithetical to the Gospel of Jesus Christ" and "denounce and repudiate white supremacy and every form of racial and ethnic hatred as of the devil," the proposed new resolution states.
The Southern Baptist Convention, based in Nashville, has 15.2 million members and is the largest Protestant group in the country. Leaders have repeatedly condemned racism in formal resolutions from past meetings and built new relationships with black Baptists.
Billy Levengood, a 32-year-old convention attendee from Oxford, Pennsylvania, said he will vote for the resolution, in part to help the denomination move beyond its origins. "We can't undo the slavery aspect, but we can do all we can to engage every person," Levengood said. "The Gospel is true for all of them."
But Daniel Brady, 66, a lifelong Southern Baptist from Flagstaff, said he would examine the language more closely before deciding his vote. He said he would support a less specific condemnation of racism, contending media sometimes categorize people as part of the "alt-right" based solely on whether they backed President Donald Trump. "We're always going to be called racists, as Southern Baptists," he said.
Ed Stetzer, a Southern Baptist speaker and executive director of the Billy Graham Center for Evangelism at Wheaton College in Illinois, said the committee in charge of resolutions should have revised the initial proposal and brought it to a vote.
"Southern Baptists need to speak to this issue," Stetzer wrote Wednesday in the evangelical magazine Christianity Today. He pointed to the denomination's history in the civil rights movement. "Too many Southern Baptists were on the wrong side of the fire hoses in Birmingham. They need to get on the correct side of the rising tide of racism," Stetzer wrote.

LANSING, Mich. (AP) — The Latest on the sexual abuse cases and investigations surrounding former sports doctor Larry Nassar (all times local):
9:40 a.m.
Michigan State University trustees have named a hard-nosed former governor and alumnus as interim president as the school faces scathing criticism over its former sports doctor, Larry Nassar.
The school's Board of Trustees unanimously voted Wednesday to hire John Engler following last week's resignation of Lou Ann Simon.
Simon stepped down after Nassar was sentenced to decades in prison for sexual abuse. He was accused of abusing young female athletes for decades under the guise of medical treatment while working for the university and USA Gymnastics.
Engler was Michigan governor from 1990 through 2002. After leaving office because of term limits, the 69-year-old Republican directed business groups in Washington.
Trustees also named another former governor, Democrat Jim Blanchard, to advise the school as it faces lawsuits filed by more than 100 girls and women and investigations by the state attorney general, the NCAA and Congress.
___
12:30 a.m.
Ex-sports doctor Larry Nassar's return to court to face another prison sentence for molesting gymnasts could unfold much the same as a hearing last week in another Michigan county.
Judge Janice Cunningham has set aside several days for roughly 60 people who want to confront Nassar or have their statement read in court. This time Nassar is to be confronted by gymnasts from an elite Michigan club run by an Olympic coach.
Last week Nassar was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison.
The hearing starting Wednesday in Eaton County centers on his assaults at Twistars, a Lansing-area gymnastics club that was run by 2012 Olympic coach John Geddert. Nassar admits penetrating three girls with his hands when he was supposed to be treating them for injuries.
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — A judge in Puerto Rico has found there is not enough evidence to charge a former U.S. Olympic volleyball player from Louisiana in the 2016 death of her young daughter.
Police had accused Kim Willoughby of murder and child abuse in the case. It was not immediately clear if Willoughby had an attorney.
Police had said in 2016 that Willoughby told them her 3-year-old daughter slipped in the shower and died after hitting her head.
On Friday, police presented charges but a judge ruled there was not enough evidence to charge her.
Willoughby had played in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and won a silver medal. She later played with a team in Puerto Rico.
Romania's constitutional court on Wednesday ruled in a 6-3 vote that President Klaus Iohannis is constitutionally obliged to sack the National Anti-Corruption Directorate (DNA) Chief Prosecutor Laura Codruta Kovesi.
The court said it would explain its ruling later, without saying when, issuing the following statement.
"The president has refused to issue the dismissal decree [...] which has blocked the justice minister from using his authority related to the prosecutors' activities," the court said in a statement. "The constitutional conduct that must be followed is for the president to issue the dismissal decree."
Hundreds of people protested near the government building in Bucharest after the ruling was announced.
Iohannis, from the center-right Union to Save Romania party, has resisted calls for him to sack Kovesi, a figure widely seen as taking on the corruption endemic to Romanian public life and touching several members of the ruling social democrats (PSD).

The court had to decide whether the president was required by the constitution to implement the request of the justice minister, Tudorel Toader, to sack Kovesi. It said there had been an "institutional conflict" that needed resolving.
According to the constitution, only the president can dismiss the DNA chief.
Since their election victory in December 2016, the PSD and its junior, liberal, partner ALDE have sought to bring the judiciary under tighter executive control
Under Kovesi's leadership, the DNA investigated 60 top-ranking officials, including a prime minister and over 40 lawmakers and other wealthy Romanians over the past four years.
Liviu Dragnea, leader of the PSD, faces charges of alleged misconduct and Kovesi's office was preparing a case against him. He was given a two-year suspended sentence in 2016 for electoral fraud.
The PSD tried in early 2017 to decriminalize several corruption offenses by emergency decree but withdrew the bill after huge street protests.
Iohannis' reaction awaited
"Regardless of what the court decides, I will wait for the motivation, I will read it and act accordingly," Iohannis told reporters before the decision.
Iohannis has said that Toader's reasoning for wanting to remove Kovesi contained "weak arguments" and had defended Kovesi's work as a prosecutor.
The independent judicial watchdog has also expressed a positive opinion of Kovesi and the EU has praised her work.
The EU has a special mechanism monitoring Romania's justice system.
Government praises ruling
Toader praised the ruling, saying Iohannis did not have "the legal ability to evaluate the professional and management competences of high-ranking prosecutors."
In a February report calling for Kovesi's dismissal, Toader said she was "authoritarian," claimed that prosecutors had falsified evidence and said the number of acquittals was too high.
Senate President Calin Popescu-Tariceanum said on Wednesday that Kovesi "should have resigned a long time ago."
Opposition up in arms
The opposition party Union to Save Romania said the ruling was politically motivated and was designed to help the PSD. It said the government wants to replace Kovesi with someone more pliable.
The party said in a statement that the court's decision "deals a heavy blow to the court's credibility."
Tensions between Romania's center-right president and the center-left government reached a nadir in April when Iohannis called for the country's Prime Minister Viorica Dancila to resign.
Hundreds of Romanians have said they will attend a demonstration in Bucharest in support of Kovesi and to "defend democracy and justice," while about 108,000 people have signed an online petition calling on Iohannis not to dismiss Kovesi.

When Javier Duarte stepped down from office last October, the former governor of Mexico's Veracruz state vowed to fight the mounting corruption allegations that unraveled his tenure.
"The circumstances created by false accusations ... force me to dedicate myself full-time to clear my name and that of my family," Duarte said on Oct. 13, according to The Yucatan Times, just one day after he ended his term six weeks early.
Then, Duarte disappeared.
It would be another half-year before the he surfaced — this time in handcuffs, escorted from his hotel at a lakeside resort in Guatemala on Saturday night. Authorities say he had been squirreled away in a hotel room with his wife, attempting to pass as a tourist.
Now he is in a prison cell in Guatemala City, awaiting his widely expected extradition back to Mexico, where Reuters reports he'll face allegations that he diverted public funds for his personal enrichment. That includes a luxury ranch — packed with paintings by masters such as Joan Miro and Leonora Carrington, the BBC reports — that authorities say was paid for by siphoned dollars.
During his roughly six years in office, Duarte's Gulf Coast state also earned the inglorious distinction of becoming "one of the world's most lethal regions for the press," according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. The CPJ estimated last year that at least 12 journalists were murdered during Duarte's tenure; other organizations have placed that number even higher.
A 2012 dispatch from CPJ correspondent Mike O'Connor explains the atmosphere that took shape under Duarte:
"Veracruz is a beautiful, long, thin state on the Gulf coast of Mexico where many journalists are terrified not only of the rampant organized crime groups that kill and control, but also of the state government. Fear that state officials will order them murdered for what they investigate or write has forced about a dozen journalists to flee the state, claiming that fear also puts a clamp on coverage for those who remain."
And that's not to mention the mass grave discovered outside Veracruz city last month that contained 252 bodies, many of which are believed to have been buried years ago.
Strikingly, Duarte's allegation-plagued tenure was by no means uncommon. The politician isn't the only former Mexican governor to draw prosecutors' attention — nor was he the only former leader in his own party, the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, to go on the lam for an extended period.
Former Tamaulipas Gov. Tomás Yarrington was caught in Florence, Italy, just last week after five years on the run. U.S. prosecutors have alleged he "accepted millions of dollars in drug cartel bribes and invested it in Texas real estate," according to The Associated Press. And The Wall Street Journal, citing orders issued by state police, says that Yarrington had been assigned eight law enforcement officers as bodyguards as late as last year.
Meanwhile former Chihuahua Gov. Cesar Duarte — no relation — has still eluded authorities after he stepped down last year. Once a rising star in the PRI like Javier Duarte (who was suspended from the party around the time of his disappearance) and Yarrington, Cesar Duarte is being pursued over embezzlement charges.
All of this makes for a rather persistent problem for the party's leader, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, who has been battling historically terrible approval ratings.
So it's not too much of a surprise that, as the AP reports, the PRI cheered the capture of the former Veracruz governor, who the party said should "be punished in an exemplary fashion, as well as anyone who is confirmed to have taken part in his criminal ring."
Still, it will do little to erase the rather unexemplary records of many governors across Mexico — and not just those in the PRI. The Duartes have plenty of company.
The Los Angeles Times breaks it down: In a country of 31 states and one federal district, nearly a dozen governors recently out of office are on the lam, under investigation or already in prison.
WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland's Senate has backed legislation regulating Holocaust speech that has sparked a diplomatic dispute with Israel and calls from the United States for a reconsideration of a bill seen as threatening freedom of speech.
The bill proposed by Poland's ruling conservative party calls for up to three years in prison for any intentional attempt to falsely attribute the crimes of Nazi Germany to the Polish state or people. It exempts artistic and research work.
Saying the bill defends Poland's good name, the senators voted early Thursday 57-23 to back the bill with two abstentions.
To become law, the bill requires approval from the president, who supports it.
Israel sees the move as an attempt to whitewash the role some Poles played in the killing of Jews during World War II.
KENNETT SQUARE >> Kennett Square residents soon will be able to save money on trash collection.
Council last week amend its ordinance to create a tiered-trash system that will give residents the opportunity to choose either a 96-gallon, a 65-gallon or a 35-gallon toter, and will create a discount program for senior citizens, and will also incorporate a senior financial hardship clause.
The program will cost the borough $15,000 as it will be ordering 200 of the 65-gallon toters and 150 of the 35-gallon toters.
Overall trash collection fees will drop slightly as the borough has added more users to the system.

“This program is a direct response to what our constituents wanted,” said Councilman Ethan Cramer.
Residents choosing the 96-gallon toter will pay $260 per year, or $65 quarterly. Those choosing the 65-gallon toter will pay $227 yearly or $56 quarterly and those choosing the 35-gallon toter will pay $194 annually or $48 quarterly.
Currently all residents have 96-gallon toters. Those who keep the 95-gallon toters will see a 3 percent decrease in trash fees in 2018; those who choose the 65-gallon toters will see a 15 percent decrease in fees, and those who choose the 35-gallon toters will realize a 27 percent decrease in trash fees next year.
The fees the borough sets is based on the cost of hauling divided among the number of pickups and the projected weight of refuse.
Dan Maffei, council president, said he is happy to see there is a provision for greater enforcement of the trash ordinance to discourage residents from overstuffing smaller toters.
Each day of the fair, there will be livestock shows, a petting zoo, ag venture barn feature interactive time with animals, livestock display in the covered arena, Ham Bone Express pig race, Banana Derby, poultry exhibits, a rabbit show, horse shows, a dog show, cat show and more.

NEW DELHI (AP) — India's government has asked WhatsApp to take immediate action to prevent the social media site from being misused to spread rumors and irresponsible statements like those blamed for recent deadly mob attacks.
At least 20 people have been killed in mostly rural villages in many Indian states by attacking mobs that were inflamed by social media. Victims were innocent people accused in the viral messages of belonging to gangs trying to abduct children.
India's ministry of electronics and information technology said in a statement late Tuesday the lynchings were tied to "irresponsible and explosive messages" circulated on WhatsApp. It wasn't specific on preventative measures it expected.
The social messaging platform owned by Facebook said in a blog it would institute awards for research on "spread of misinformation" on its platform.
Data for police shootings is usually the subset that only includes fatalities. Vice News made requests nationwide to get data on people who were shot but not killed by police. To accompany their story, Vice News made the data and code available for download:
Ultimately, we obtained some data from 47 departments — with 4,099 incidents in all. Departments in New York’s Suffolk and Nassau Counties didn’t provide us with any data. Maryland’s Montgomery County Police Department gave us only partial incident-level information and no total number of police shootings, so we excluded them from the analysis. We put all this information together to analyze trends across the departments and to compare them with one another — the first time this has ever been done for both fatal and nonfatal shootings.
Get the data and look for yourself.
Thieves reportedly cut off Israeli vehicles on the road - then forced them to stop, allowing them to steal victim's car.
A car theft ring made up of three Palestinian Authority Arabs was broken up early Wednesday morning, following a string of carjacking incidents in the Binyamin region of Samaria.
The three suspects were captured by IDF forces and Israel Police units operating in an Arab village in the Binyamin area.
Authorities say the three carjackers would use their vehicles to pull in front of Israeli cars driving in the area, then slow down and stop, blocking the Israeli drivers’ path. Once the Israeli car had been forced to stop, the carjackers would exit their vehicles, drag the Israeli drivers out by force, then steal their cars to a nearby Arab village.
During the arrest operation Wednesday morning, Israeli security personnel and police located a vehicle owned by an Israeli man from Ofra, whose car had been stolen Tuesday morning on Route 465 near Bir Zeit.
Other stolen property was also recovered during the arrest operation.
The three suspects are slated to be brought before an army court in Samaria for an extension of their arrests.
“Israel Police will continue to fight with uncompromising determination against gangs of thieves trying to harm the security and property of residents,” a police spokesperson said following the arrests.
TAIPEI (Taiwan News) - As the government’s “New Southbound Policy” has entered into full force and effect, Taiwan is aiming for deeper trade relations with India, an economic bright spot that has enjoyed remarkable growth in recent years.
The policy, which aims to strengthen Taiwan’s trade and economic ties with a total of 18 countries in South and Southeast Asia, has underlined India as one of the six targeted countries to be included in the first phase.
India, the second-most populous country and the most populous democracy in the world, is also one of the most promising economies. Its economic growth is forecast to be between 6.75 percent and 7.5 percent in the coming financial year, according to official estimates.
In fact, India is projected to replace the United States as the world’s second largest economy after China by 2050.
In a report by the international professional services firm PwC released last week, it claims that by 2050, emerging economies will be the driving force of global economic growth, while India, Vietnam, and Bangladesh could be the three fastest growing economies.
“India will drive the shift in global economic power and could overtake the U.S. to be the world’s second largest economy in PPP (purchasing power parity) terms by 2050,” the report said.
While India is projected to continue its current strong growth rates, Taiwan has wasted no time in trying to build closer ties with the seventh-largest economy in the world.
Last week, a parliamentary delegation from Taiwan visited India to engage with their counterparts, an effort to increase parliamentary exchange and further assist the government in structuring the policy.
Business-wise, the Times of India reported last Friday that the Taiwan-based contract electronics maker Wistron Corp. (緯創) has announced its plan to set up a plant in India to roll out iPhones for tech giant Apple Inc.
On the other hand, Foxconn Technology Group, the world’s largest contract electronics maker as well as Apple’s major iPhone supplier, has already entered India a couple of years ago with operations in Sri City, Andhra Pradesh, Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu, and Navi Mumbai in Maharashtra, according to the report.
In January, Taiwan’s Representative to India, Tien Chung-kwang（田中光）, noted in a media interview the convergence of interest between the two nations.
While both share concerns over China’s assertiveness, India’s “Act East Policy”, introduced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as an upgrade to the former “Look East Policy”, aims to bolster extensive strategic and economic ties with East and Southeast Asian countries.
The policy shares a critical mutual interest with Taiwan’s “New Southbound Policy,” said Tien, adding that it is now in the best interest of both nations to pursue stronger bilateral ties.

Super Rugby-winning coach Chris Boyd will leave the Wellington-based Hurricanes at the end of the tournament to join England club Northampton as its director of rugby.
Boyd, who is also a former coach of the New Zealand Under-20s, was seen as a possible future All Blacks coach but has chosen to join an exodus of top New Zealand coaching talent to overseas clubs.
He follows Dave Rennie, who won two Super Rugby titles with the Chiefs and is now coaching in Scotland, and Jamie Joseph, who guided the Highlanders to a maiden Super Rugby title, and is now coaching Japan.
Boyd said it was tough to leave the Hurricanes after four seasons "but the opportunity at Northampton presented an exciting new challenge that was too good to pass up."
BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Along dimmed corridors in an elegant villa in central Belgrade, visitors are treated to a flashy presentation of Nikola Tesla's technology — as well as a huge array of the visionary scientist's clothes, hundreds of instruments, and even his ashes.
The Serbian museum, dedicated to everything to do with the 19th-century inventor and electricity pioneer, remained in relative obscurity for decades under the communist-run former Yugoslavia. But thanks to a global revival of interest in the scientist, the collection is now drawing big crowds from home and abroad.
Museum staff say some 130,000 people visited last year, compared to about 30,000 a year in the past — when its audience included generations of local school children but hardly anyone from abroad. Now the small museum is ranked among the top must-see destination for tourists.
Tesla is best known for developing the alternating current that helped safely distribute electricity at great distances, including from the hydro-electric plant at the Niagara Falls in mid-1890s. He experimented with X-ray and radio technology, working in rivalry with Thomas Edison.
Although he's known to many science lovers, his following and name-recognition among the general public has rocketed in recent years thanks to Paypal billionaire Elon Musk's Tesla electric car. In the U.S., Tesla admirers have raised money through crowdfunding to purchase his laboratory In Shoreham, N.Y.
An ethnic Serb born in 1856 in the Austrian Empire in present-day Croatia, Tesla spent most of his life abroad, working in Budapest and Paris before emigrating to the U.S. in 1884.
The Tesla Museum in Belgrade holds a vast array of the scientist's personal items, from his sleepwear, shaving kit, tailor-made suit and cane to tens of thousands of documents and his awards. Even pieces of furniture from the New Yorker Hotel room 3327, where Tesla spent the last ten years of his life — his bed, fridge, metal lockers and a cupboard — are included.
"He was a man who took great care of his belongings and saved a large number of documents, so thanks to that we can now reconstruct his life and his work," curator Milica Kesler said. "He was fully aware of the importance of what he was doing."
Packed in some sixty trunks and containers, Tesla's entire property first arrived in the former Yugoslavia on a ship from New York in 1951, eight years after his death. Authorities set up the museum in 1952, which later struggled with scarce funds and low attendance.
Nowadays, thrilled visitors are given fluorescent light sticks that light up wirelessly with the discharge from the Tesla coil, a four-meter-tall transformer circuit that generates electricity. In a separate room, in a somewhat macabre setting of dimmed lights and dark drapes, are Tesla's ashes in a golden ball urn.
There are now so many visitors that the museum has extended its working hours and introduced more guided tours. Museum worker Pavle Petrovic says "the holiday season is the busiest, of course, but numbers stay high throughout the year."
Although Tesla visited Belgrade just once for 31 hours, Serbia celebrates him as the pride of the nation. Belgrade's airport and a new city boulevard are named after Tesla, his image is on souvenirs, and the Serbian Orthodox Church wants Tesla's ashes placed in the country's main religious temple, triggering protests by the liberal scientific community.
Typical of the Balkan divide, neighboring Croatia also claims Tesla as its own, turning his house in the home village of Smiljan into a memorial center. The rival former Yugoslav republics have marked important dates in Tesla's life separately amid strained relations stemming from the 1990s' bloody breakup of the joint ex-federation.
Away from the crowds, Tesla's archive of more than 160,000 documents, scientific plans, manuscripts and letters is stored carefully in the museum's basement. Curator Kesler said Tesla made the experts' job easy by keeping a neat chronology of the documents.
"Sometimes I have a feeling he left us some kind of a path, a guideline to follow," she said with a smile.

WEST HOLLYWOOD, CA (CBS Local) – Love is no match for man’s best friend. According to a new survey, an overwhelming number of adults would dump their partner if they didn’t like their dog.
A survey of 3,500 dog owners conducted by dog-walking service Wag!, found that 86 percent of respondents would end a relationship if their boyfriend or girlfriend couldn’t get along with their dog.
“It comes as no surprise to us at Wag! that dog parents place a premium on their dogs’ opinions of other humans and that this plays a deciding factor in their love lives,” company CEO Hilary Schneider said, via StudyFinds.
In some cases, spouses are even taking a back seat to their husband or wife’s four-legged friend. 16 percent of married dog owners said they preferred celebrating their pet’s birthday over their own spouse’s.
However, the news isn’t all bad as dogs were found to be the key to many people’s hearts. Over 70 percent of people surveyed said they were more likely to “swipe right” if a person’s online dating profile featured their pup. Six in 10 adults claim they were flirted with while walking their furry friend.
For singles, Wag! says forget the pickup lines and get a dog. Nearly 80 percent of dog owners admit they’d be more likely to go home with someone if that person said they had a dog there waiting to meet them.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) – Philippine singer, actor, and YouTuber Mikey Bustos debuted a music video featuring his impressions of Taipei at a press event on July 3 as part of a promotion campaign to boost bilateral tourism by the Department of Information and Tourism of Taipei City.
The 4-minute clip, lyricized and sung by Mikey himself, tells a story about how he has a crush on a girl from Taipei who is sweet and amiable and takes him on a tour of the capital of Taiwan.
To shoot the music video, Mikey said he had the opportunity to taste a remarkable variety of signature local delicacies including beef noodle, mango shaved ice, xiaolongbao, stinky tofu, and more. “Taipei is a wonderful city boasting a great deal of cuisines and many marvelous things,” said Mikey, who recommended the tourist bus as a transportation means to explore the city.
The tourism agency also took the opportunity to announce a host of travel deals in collaboration with the Philippine Straits Travel Agency, EVA Air, and the Taipei Sightseeing Bus to lure visitors from the Southeast Asian country. The packages, spotlighting itineraries from gastronomical attractions to cultural spots, will be available starting July 5.
According to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in the Philippines, Taiwan has seen a surge of tourist arrivals from the Philippines since the implementation of the visa waiver program last November. 2017 reported a 68 percent year-on-year increase in the number of Filipino visitors, while this year a 60 percent hike was logged between January and May compared to the same period last year.

LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) — Jamie Greubel Poser drives a bobsled for the United States. Her husband competes for Germany. And her sister hails from South Korea.
That all intersects at the Pyeongchang Olympics.
Greubel Poser is looking to add to her medal collection after winning a bronze at the Sochi Games four years ago. Her husband, Christian Poser, will compete in likely medal-contending sleds for Germany in the two- and four-man events. And they'll race in the homeland of Greubel Poser's adopted sister, who has not been in South Korea since she was an infant 18 years ago.
"It's amazing and it's definitely what makes this Olympics so meaningful and special to me," Greubel Poser said. "I can't wait to be there and just have it be real. When I was in Sochi that was what made it really feel like the Olympics for me, knowing that my family was in Russia. So knowing that my family will be in South Korea, especially my sister, is just going to make this the best time ever."
Here's another element to her Olympic tale: She could most definitely win.
It won't be easy. Canada's Kaillie Humphries has been the world's best this season and is looking for her third consecutive Olympic gold medal, while longtime U.S. star Elana Meyers Taylor drove to silver at the Sochi Games. There's a clear perception around women's bobsledding that those are the best two drivers in the world, and it's been that way for some time.
To change that thinking, Greubel Poser likely needs Olympic gold.
"It's definitely fuel to the fire," Greubel Poser said.
When the track in Pyeongchang played host to a World Cup event last winter as its dress-rehearsal for the Olympics, Greubel Poser and Aja Evans prevailed to lead a gold-silver finish by the Americans. Greubel Poser and Evans were the bronze-winning duo for the U.S. in Sochi despite having limited time in a sled together beforehand. USA Bobsled decided to pair them again in Pyeongchang.
This wasn't Greubel Poser's best World Cup season; she was fourth in the final standings, albeit with one victory and two runner-up finishes. But she's also the only women's driver on the planet who knows what it takes to win in Pyeongchang.
"It all came together that week," Greubel Poser said.
In her last 44 major international races, Greubel Poser has six wins, six silvers and 16 bronzes — meaning she emerges from races with a medal 64 percent of the time. And out of her 11 medal-winning starts over the last two years, Evans has been in the sled for eight of them.
"She's after the same thing that I'm after now, which is the same thing we were after in Sochi," Evans said. "We felt like we didn't have enough time together before Sochi. Jamie's like a driver version of me. You can see it in her eyes. She's got no problem with confidence. She's going for it every time she touches the ice, and I really, really like that."
In other words, every race means a lot to Greubel Poser.
There's no denying that this one will mean considerably more.
Elizabeth Greubel has never been trackside for one of her sister's races; she's still in high school, and the schedules have never really aligned to give her time to head to a World Cup venue. But the whole family has been planning to be in Pyeongchang for some time, and it was one of the first thoughts that went through Greubel Poser's head when South Korea was announced as the winner of this Olympic bid seven years ago.
It's been a motivating factor ever since.
"My sister knows I'm an Olympian, but when I'm with my sister, I'm her sister and not an Olympic athlete," Greubel Poser said. "She humbles me. She humbles me real quick. I love her for that. I think she's excited for me because it's the Olympics, and of course it's interesting for her to go back and see where she was born."
This is Greubel Poser's second Olympics, after narrowly missing a spot on the team as a push athlete for the Vancouver Games in 2010. Not getting to those games was what made her decide to switch to driving, and her career has been going the right way ever since.
And now comes an opportunity for what would be the ultimate victory for her entire family, on her sport's biggest stage.
"This was meant to be," Greubel Poser said. "I know what I'm capable of doing, I know what I've done, and I'm ready to go do it."

Two women spoke out publicly on Monday, accusing actor Steven Seagal of sexually assaulting them when they were in their teens.The two women, Regina Simons and Faviola Dadis, gave their accounts of the alleged incidents during a news conference alongside their attorney, Lisa Bloom.Simons said she was cast as an extra on Seagal's 1994 thriller "On Deadly Ground." When the film was completed, she said the actor invited her to a wrap party at his house. She soon noticed she was the only one there.When she asked where everyone was, Seagal told her everyone left the party. It was then that he took her hand and led her into a room, she said."He closed the door and approached me from behind. He started kissing my neck and taking off my clothes. I was in shock," she said. "Seagal was more than twice my size and twice my age. I was not sexually active or had ever been naked in front of a man before."She said he had sex with her while tears ran down her face."There was nothing consensual about this," she said.She said when he was done, he asked her if she needed any money. She told him "no" and ran for the door.Simons said he tried to contact her after the incident, but she did not speak with him or come forward with her story. She said she was too depressed and traumatized and has come forward now as an attempt to heal."I pray that my abuser can also heal. I want him to be aware...and apologize," Simons said.Dadis said she was 17 years old when she was sexually assaulted in 2002. As a model and vocalist at the time, she was introduced to Seagal for a recording project.Following two auditions, she said they were friends who spoke by text. Soon after, Dadis was invited to another audition for Seagal to "evaluate" her figure to see if she would be suitable for the role."He asked me to book a room myself at the W in Beverly Hills, and I explained that I did not have the funds to do so, and I did not feel comfortable doing this, and I suggested he should book the hotel himself, and he did," Dadis said.Seagal's assistant asked her to wear a bikini or bra and panties underneath her clothes and said it's standard procedure, so Dadis agreed.Once in the elevator, the assistant allegedly said, "Steven's word is as good as gold," and then left the two alone. Dadis said she was surprised but did not comment.While inside the room, Seagal asked Dadis to take off her clothes and do a catwalk across the room."I did so and Steven approached me and said that he would like to act out a romantic scene to get a sense of our chemistry. I felt uncomfortable, and I shyly expressed this," she said.Dadis detailed that Seagal ignored her wishes and slipped his hands inside her bikini and on private areas."Steven sat there calmly as if nothing had happened while I was visibly upset," Dadis said.She said his security guard blocked the doorway and only moved when Seagal signaled him to do so.Dadis said Seagal attempted to reach out to her after that night, but she did not respond. She said she didn't tell anyone about the incident for a month because she felt it was her fault."After many years, I've finally reported this incident to the LAPD in hopes that my statement will provide support for other women," Dadis said.The Los Angeles Police Department confirms it has opened a criminal investigation into an alleged sexual assault by Seagal.Multiple actresses have accused Seagal of sexually harassing them. He has not commented on the accusations.
Gandelina Damião, 78, is permanently hunched, carrying her sorrow. She lost three children to heroin in the 1990s.
A quarter century ago, her cobblestone lane, up a grassy hill from Lisbon's Tagus River, was littered with syringes. She recalls having to search for her teenagers in graffitied stone buildings nearby, where they would shoot up.
"It was a huge blow," Damião says, pointing to framed photos on her wall of Paulo, Miguel and Liliana. "I was a good mother. I never gave them money for drugs. But I couldn't save them."
For much of the 20th century, Portugal was a closed, Catholic society, with a military dictator and no drug education. In the early 1970s, young Portuguese men were drafted to fight wars in the country's African colonies, where many were exposed to drugs for the first time. Some came home addicted.
In 1974, there was a revolution — and an explosion of freedom.
"It was a little bit like the Americans in Vietnam. Whiskey was cheaper than water, and cannabis was easy to access. So people came home from war with some [drug] habits," says João Goulão, Portugal's drug czar. "Suddenly everything was different [after the revolution]. Freedom! And drugs were something that came with that freedom. But we were completely naive."
By the 1990s, 1 percent of Portugal's population was hooked on heroin. It was one of the worst drug epidemics in the world, and it prompted Portugal's government to take a novel approach: It decriminalized all drugs. Starting in 2001, possession or use of any drug — even heroin — has been treated as a health issue, not a crime.
Goulão, who had worked as a family physician in his 20s, at the height of the crisis, says there was very little opposition to the policy change.
"Every family had its own drug addict. It was so, so present in everyday life, that it turned public opinion," Goulão says. "We are dealing with a chronic relapsing disease, and this is a disease like any other. I do not put a diabetic in jail, for instance."
Under the 2001 decriminalization law, authored by Goulão, drug dealers are still sent to prison. But anyone caught with less than a 10-day supply of any drug — including heroin — gets mandatory medical treatment. No judge, no courtroom, no jail.
Instead they end up in a sparsely furnished, discreet, unmarked office in downtown Lisbon, for counselling with government sociologists, who decide whether to refer them to drug treatment centers.
"It's cheaper to treat people than to incarcerate them," says sociologist Nuno Cabaz. "If I come across someone who wants my help, I'm in a much better position to provide it than a judge would ever be. Simple as that."
Cabaz's team of 10 counselors handles all of Lisbon's roughly 2,500 drug cases a year. It may sound like a lot, but it's actually a 75 percent drop from the 1990s. Portugal's drug-induced death rate has plummeted to five times lower than the European Union average.
Along a row of abandoned buildings in northern Lisbon, field psychologists took NPR to meet some of Portugal's remaining drug users. The hillside is littered with needles, and bursting with wildflowers. The sky rumbles with airliners landing at the international airport nearby.
There's a philosophy book on a cement stoop next to a middle-aged man who's smoking crack cocaine. He gives his name as Rui, and says the stigma against addicts has eased since decriminalization.
"Now, not so much. It's less, because the methadone is coming, and people are treating this problem," he says. "They see the drugs with another perspective."
Every day, a government van pulls up and gives him a dose of methadone, an opioid that helps wean people off of heroin. It's a step toward harm-reduction. He still does cocaine, but no longer shoots up.
Drug-related HIV infections in Portugal have dropped 95 percent.
Drug workers hand out packets with clean needles and condoms, and listen to another addict, Antonio, describe his anxiety.
"If the drugs hurt too much my body, I escape a little, and then I come back again," he says. "But it's a world I cannot escape! If I turn there, it's there — it's everywhere. I cannot escape."
For every person in Portugal who cannot escape addiction, there's daily methadone, counseling and free treatment. A generation ago, these addicts were put in jail. Now they're on the street.
But polls show the Portuguese — having lived through the ravages of a heroin epidemic — overwhelmingly support this policy.
ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is appearing before a Supreme Court-appointed team investigating allegations against his family's offshore companies and money laundering.
Authorities have made strict security arrangements at a building where Sharif will appear before noon Thursday. His two sons have already testified and denied the allegations against their family's financial affairs.
Sharif, who says he never misused his authority to enrich himself, has been under pressure to resign since reports based on documents leaked from a Panama-based law firm indicated his sons owned offshore companies.
The Supreme Court, after hearing petitions for months against Sharif and his family, has ruled there was not enough evidence to remove him from office but ordered an investigation team to look further into the allegations.
HAMPTON BAYS, N.Y. (CBSNewYork) — A school war is brewing in the Hamptons.
Are families illegally living year round in transient hotels, and sending their children to school tax-free?
The Hampton Bays School District is demanding millions in compensation.
Because of its prime location — bays, inlets, canals, and ocean — Hampton Bays long served the summer tourist crowds, but many of its motels and hotels are struggling in the off season and beyond now renting rooms to families during the school year.
“We are living in a house, but other friends, they are in a bad situation right now,” Tony Brenes said.
He said his friends are in hotels and motels, and sending their kids to school.
The Hampton Bays school district — in an unusual turn of events — has filed a notice of claim against the town saying it wants $10-million from Southampton as compensation for educating children living in transient hotels.
“The properties have done damage to the Hampton Bays union-free school district in unrecovered pupil costs of over $10.5-million,” a document claims.
The notice also accuses local officials of failing to enforce the zoning code by permitting long-term residential use of transient hotels or motels.
“We will defend the town and the facts are entirely on our side,” Town Supervisor, Jay Schneiderman said.
The complaint is coming out of the blue. Property values have been steadily rising, and school enrollment is on the decline.
“Things are moving in the right direction in Hampton Bays, it is just sad that the school can’t see it. Instead of a pat on the back, we get a slap in the face,” Schneiderman said.
Some called the threatened lawsuit ‘veiled discrimination.’
“The kids at the school make dinners for us, Christmas, different times. You should see these schools, you should see what the kids do,” Linda Esposito said.
Others said they worry about taxes.
“I think it’s really selling the kids short if you’re not paying taxes to go toward the school,” one homeowner said.
The school’s claim is false, Schneiderman said. He said the town, aggressively enforcing its code, is doing more to revitalize the hamlet, so motels and hotels are viable and not home to drifters.
He said the goal is to create affordable housing east of the Shinnecock Canal while enforcing and revitalizing neighborhoods.

VAN VLECK, Texas (AP) — Residents of a coastal area southwest of Houston are cleaning up debris after at least six tornadoes left a swath of damaged buildings.
Among the homes destroyed was one where a woman inside held tightly to her two young children.
Anthony Ovesny told KPRC-TV in Houston that his wife, Ashlie Ovesny, was home Tuesday with their children, ages 1 and 3, when a tornado touched down in Van Vleck.
The tornado flipped their mobile home and turned it to rubble. Neighbors pulled Ashlie Ovesny and the children from the debris. She's recovering after having surgery for fractures. The children had minor injuries.
The tornado was rated an EF1, with winds of 86 to 110 mph.
An EF2 tornado with winds of 111 to 135 mph damaged subdivisions closer to Houston.
LONDON (AP) — Ireland says it will begin collecting more than 13 billion euros ($15.9 billion) of back taxes from Apple, 19 months after the European Commission ruled that a tax deal with the tech giant amounted to illegal state aid.
The Commission ordered Ireland to collect back taxes for the years 2003-2014, which it estimated at 13 billion euros plus interest. Ireland disagreed, saying the ruling undermined the integrity of the country's tax system.
But Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe says he will on Tuesday sign an agreement setting up the escrow account that will hold the payments while Apple and Ireland appeal. The payments should be completed by September.
Donohoe says the government "fundamentally disagrees with the ruling," but "Ireland is intent on complying with our binding legal obligations in this regard."
The Sonoma County Sheriff's Office announced Monday the arrest of an eighth suspect in three home invasion robberies in Petaluma last week.Jade Lafay Johnson, 19, of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, was taken into custody Thursday by Winston-Salem police during a traffic stop in Winston Salem.Sonoma County sheriff's detectives flew to North Carolina over the weekend to interview Johnson, who is being held under $1 million bail and will be extradited to Sonoma County to face trial, sheriff's Sgt. Spencer Crum said.All eight suspects in the three Petaluma home invasion robberies on March 12 were from the East Coast, primarily from Richmond, Virginia, and Winston-Salem, Crum said.The suspects were looking for marijuana when they broke into three homes in the 100 and 200 blocks of Eugenia Drive around 3 a.m., tied up the occupants and pistol-whipped one occupant. There was no marijuana at any of the homes, Crum said.Four men were arrested after a subsequent pursuit into Novato, and three men were arrested around 7:30 p.m. that day when they tried to board a plane to the East Coast from San Francisco International Airport, Crum said.The seven suspects were booked into Sonoma County Jail on suspicion of robbery of an inhabited dwelling, burglary, false imprisonment, kidnapping and conspiracy. Six of the men are being held under $1 million bail and one is on no-bail status.
The 25-year-old Canadian man accused of mowing down pedestrians with a van in northern Toronto Monday has been charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and 13 counts of attempted murder.Alek Minassian, with a stone-faced expression and clad in a white jail jumpsuit, appeared in court this morning in Toronto, which is the sprawling capital of Ontario province. He is scheduled to appear in court again May 10 via video link.Minassian was arrested and taken into custody Monday as the suspected driver in the van attack, which killed 10 people and injured 15 others, according to the Toronto Police Service.Neighbors of Minassian, who lived in the Toronto suburb of Richmond Hills, described him as very quiet and odd. They told ABC News they saw him in the neighborhood -- including one neighbor who said he regularly saw him jogging -- but had never spoken to him.At a news conference in Canada's capital this morning, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau provided no suspected motive for the attack but said investigators still "have no reason to suspect that there is any national security element to this attack.""Obviously, all Canadians continue and will continue to have questions about why this happened, what could possibly be the motives behind it," Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa. "As was indicated last night by our public security minister, at this time we have no reason to suspect that there is any national security element to this attack, but obviously the investigations continue."Monday's attack began at Yonge Street and Finch Avenue in Toronto's bustling North York neighborhood, police said. The suspect then drove the white Ryder van south for nearly 1 1/2 miles, ramming into more pedestrians at Yonge Street and Sheppard Avenue. The vehicle finally stopped on Poyntz Avenue, just off Yonge Street.Witness Ali Shaker saw the van jump the sidewalk and said people walking were "crumbled up," he told Canada's CTV News "He's just hitting people one by one, going down," Shaker said. "It was a nightmare."Visibly frightened by what he saw, Shaker could barely recount the horror he witnessed. He said he was driving when the incident occurred."I'm so shaky -- I can't believe this is happening," he said. "This is so unbelievable."Shaker initially assumed the driver was experiencing some kind of medical emergency, he said, and even attempted to try to stop the driver from causing more carnage."I thought he had a heart attack or something so I was trying to chase him on the way, almost trying to catch up," he told CTV News, adding that the driver was moving fast."He hit everybody on the sidewalk; anybody in his way he would hit," Shaker added. "The bus stop -- all shattered. There was a lady in there I saw and I stopped and I looked and I went after and all I see is just crumbling one by one."Phil Zullo, who also witnessed the attack, told CTV News he saw "shoes and hats flown everywhere."Another witness said he stopped outside of a building for a smoke break and saw a middle-aged man get struck as he was crossing the street."As I lit up my cigarette I saw a man walking in the middle of the intersection and a van plowed right into him," the witness, who went by Steve, told CTV News. "I saw the guy go flying. ... It was just clear as day, just saw the guy get hit by the van and pieces of the van fell off."Afterward, Steve said he rushed into the middle of the street to tend to the injured man "to make sure no other cars struck him."The victim, he said, was around 50, was unconscious "and could barely move."The van kept driving and hit others, Steven added, leaving behind pools of blood."I saw three or four [people] on the ground around me," he said. "Other people were getting CPR."He's convinced that stopping for the cigarette break saved him, Steve said."I had just stopped to light the cigarette and if I hadn't done that I would have been killed as well," he said. "I would have been right there with that guy."Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto confirmed in a statement that it had received a total of 10 patients from Monday's incident. Two of them were pronounced dead upon arrival. Five others were in critical condition and three were in serious condition, the hospital said.Images from the scene showed multiple victims on the ground, while video showed the moment a single police officer confronted the suspect on the street.In the video, taken by an onlooker, the officer draws his firearm and faces off against the suspect, who appears to be pointing an object. The two exchange words, and the suspect eventually drops the object he was holding and gets down on the sidewalk, allowing the officer to handcuff him.During this morning's press conference, Trudeau called the incident "a senseless attack and a horrific tragedy." He told reporters he spoke with Ontario's premier and Toronto's mayor Monday night.Trudeau will go to Toronto "as soon as it makes sense to do so," he said, but doesn't want to distract from the investigation for now.Toronto Mayor John Tory told reporters Monday afternoon that his "thoughts are with those affected by this incident." He said the beautiful weather meant many people were out on the street."There were a lot of pedestrians out," Tory said, "enjoying the sunny afternoon."Canadian Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Ralph Goodale called the incident an attack but said he didn't want to speculate when asked whether the terrorism was to blame."We cannot come to any firm conclusions at this stage," Goodale told reporters Monday. "The police are conducting their thorough investigation into what happened and why it happened."U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen is in Toronto as part of the G-7 Security Ministerial, which is set to conclude today. A senior official with the U.S. Department of State told ABC News the U.S. delegation is safe.The White House released its first comment on the attack late-Monday night, saying, "The United States stands with the Canadian people in the aftermath of today's tragic event in Toronto, where a van drove into a crowd of people killing several and injuring many more.""Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of those affected, and we wish a full recovery to those injured," the statement continued. "The United States Government pledges to provide any support Canada may need."Ryder, the brand of rental truck involved in the incident, said in a statement it was saddened by "this tragic event" and extended its "deepest sympathies" to those impacted.The company also stated that it is "cooperating fully with authorities."

Telstra has confirmed that around 1400 employees are set to lose their jobs.
The telco today briefed its staff on the cuts.
In November, the telco revealed that it was planning to find more than $1 billion in savings to offset the impact of the National Broadband Network on its business.
“Today, we’re providing a target of more than $1 billion net reduction in our underlying core fixed costs by FY 21,” chief financial officer Warwick Bray said.
“Because this productivity target is net, it goes directly to offsetting the NBN impact.” The productivity target equated “to a more than two per cent annual reduction in our underlying core fixed costs,” the CFO said.
Telstra has said it expects the NBN to have an ongoing negative impact on EBITDA of $2 to $3 billion annually once migration to the new network is complete.
In a note sent to employees today, Telstra CEO Andrew Penn said that company needed to “transform, urgently”. Telstra faces significant challenges in the face of digital disruption and increased competitive pressures, as well as the impact of the NBN.
“This means we will need to become a leaner organisation, one built on digitised systems and services for customers and employees, and one where we will continue to rely on partners for scale,” the CEO said.
The company is undertaking a restructure across its Operations, Retail, Global Enterprise and Services, and Media & Marketing groups, the CEO wrote.
The changes will see up to 1400 roles cut over the next six months. Roles will be cut from most part of the business and affect staff in all states and territories and all levels of seniority and also affect some overseas roles.
“As a company, we are facing rapidly changing customer expectations, intensified market pressures and increasing competition, disruptive technology changes and shifting industry economics,” Penn wrote.
“This includes things that we have talked about previously – the $2-3 billion EBITDA gap due to the rollout of the nbn; margins on resale of the nbn likely to be lower than today; and meeting our customers’ increasing expectations of us.”
A new organisational structure will be rolled out across Operations “to provide end-to-end responsibility and reduce complexity in four key lines of business – Networks, nbn & Commercial Delivery, IT and Digital Solutions, and Customer Service Management. “
Telstra Retail will be renamed Telstra Consumer & Small Business and evolve “to bring together like capabilities from across the group to create three core divisions – Customer Experience & Transformation, Telstra Products, and Consumer & Small Business Sales & Service”.
In Global Enterprise and Services, sales and services will be rolled into one team and the business renamed Telstra Enterprise.
Telstra Business will be eliminated, with functions shifted either into Consumer & Small Business or Enterprise.
Telstra’s Media & Marketing will also see changes to “focus more on the customer and be more agile in how we work we are streamlining how we go to market, including bringing together our domestic and international marketing teams for Enterprise and continuing to make changes in our Media Team to better deliver our media strategy, which is growing in importance to Telstra”.
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on the first state dinner of the Trump administration (all times local):
6:30 p.m.
The White House has some extra help in the kitchen for the state dinner honoring the president of France.
Former National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton is lending his skills to the occasion Tuesday night.
Anton is known for being particularly talented in the kitchen. In fact, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders cited his "amazing chef" skills in a statement earlier this month on his departure. The White House is serving rack of lamb for the main course.
Anton resigned from the White House just before new national security adviser John Bolton came on board.
He is now a writer and lecturer at Hillsdale College.

5:30 p.m.
Melania Trump is embracing her moment in the spotlight for the French president's state visit.
She traded in her usual dark sunglasses for a white wide-brimmed hat that quickly became a trending topic on social media. She has thrown herself into planning the state dinner for President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte. All eyes will be on the former model again Tuesday when she steps out in a designer gown to greet the Macrons as they arrive for dinner.
Seeing the gown is typically the highlight of a state dinner. But for once, it may pale in comparison to the hat.
The hat bobbed up and down across the bottom of TV screens as the first lady took her seat for the president's news conference with Macron.
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The craze for smartphones, social media and universal connectivity is generating immense wealth but also deep unease in South Korea, source of a large share of the computer chips that make them work.
Soaring demand for microchips used in smartphones, computer servers and data centers is driving profits for chip and smartphone maker Samsung Electronics and its smaller rival SK Hynix sky high, helping sustain growth in Asia's fourth largest economy.
Samsung reported Wednesday that its annual net profit rose 84 percent to a record 41.3 trillion won ($38.6 billion) in 2017 on annual sales of 239.6 trillion won ($223.7 billion), up 19 percent from the previous year.
But pressures are building as youth unemployment approaches 10 percent and many elderly Koreans scrimp and scavenge to get by.
WASHINGTON (AP) — With the 2018 primary season already underway, leaders of the Senate intelligence committee are launching an effort to protect U.S. elections from a repeat episode of foreign interference.
Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr of North Carolina and Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the panel, will preview some of the committee's recommendations for improving the nation's election infrastructure at a news conference Tuesday. On Wednesday, the committee will hold a hearing examining attempted hacks on state elections systems in 2016 and the federal and state response to those efforts.
The committee has prepared a larger report on the issue, one of what could be several reports to come out of the committee's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Burr and Warner have said this report is the most urgent because of the threat that it could happen again in 2018. It's unclear when the full report will be released, but it is expected to include recommendations for elections officials around the country and also proposals for legislation to help ward off the hacking.
Overall, experts say far too little has been done to shore up vulnerabilities in 10,000 U.S. voting jurisdictions that mostly run on obsolete and imperfectly secured technology. Russian agents targeted election systems in 21 states ahead of the 2016 general election, the Homeland Security Department has said, and separately launched a social media blitz aimed at inflaming social tensions and sowing confusion. Top U.S. intelligence officials have said they've seen indications Russian agents are preparing a new round of election subterfuge this year.
There's no evidence that any hack in the November 2016 election affected election results, but the attempts scared state election officials who sought answers about how their systems had been potentially compromised. DHS took nearly a year to inform the affected states of hacking attempts, blaming it in part on a lack of security clearances. Lawmakers in both parties have pressed the department on why it took so long.
Warner has said he thinks the process to prevent such hacking needs to be more robust, especially since President Donald Trump has not addressed the matter as an urgent problem.
"We've got bipartisan agreement we have to do something on this," Warner said earlier this year.
At the hearing Wednesday, former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and current Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen will both testify.
The Senate intelligence panel has put off making any assessments about whether Trump's 2016 campaign in any way coordinated with Russia. Though that is one part of the panel's investigation, Burr and Warner have decided to focus on less controversial issues where all members agree.
How should educators confront bigotry, racism and white supremacy? The incidents in Charlottesville, Va., this past weekend pushed that question from history to current events.
One teacher wondering aloud about his role is Derek Weimer. He taught James Alex Fields Jr., the man charged with murdering a woman and injuring multiple others by driving his car into a crowd of anti-racist marchers this weekend.
Weimer says he taught Fields in three classes at Cooper High School in Union, Ky. As NPR reported, he told member station WVXU reporter Bill Rinehart:
Weimer says Fields was intelligent and didn't cause trouble. But he says the quiet boy was also deeply into Adolf Hitler and white supremacy. Weimer says he did his best to steer Fields away from those interests and thought he had succeeded in doing so. On hearing about the incident in Charlottesville, Weimer said he felt that he failed as a teacher.
For 40 years, the nonprofit Facing History and Ourselves has been training teachers to confront racism and bigotry. By studying the moral decisions facing people at historical moments, from Reconstruction to Kristallnacht to the civil rights era, they hope "to empower students to work against bigotry and injustice or improper uses of power," says Roger Brooks, president and CEO. "We sum everything up by saying people make choices and choices make history."
Studies show that the curriculum produces academic, social and emotional gains in students. A time like this, says Brooks, is the ultimate teachable moment:
"There's a whole lot teachers can slow down and unpack with their students rather than get completely caught up in the emotion of the moment."
Indeed, just hours after the attack, teachers were sharing resources online, and we heard from more after reaching out in our newsletter. Here are some resources and ideas for the fast-approaching school year.
Just starting out
More than 80 percent of public school teachers are white, while half of all students are people of color. Some teachers may never have directly talked about race or racism, particularly with younger children. Brooks suggests they start by making an "identity chart". This is a way to find commonalities as well as celebrate differences.
Diverse books: Some teachers will introduce topics of racism, civil rights and diversity, especially to younger students, through books. Here is a curated list of 50 social justice books from the nonprofit Teaching for Change. Here is a second, broken down by grade level, by The National Network of State Teachers of the Year.
Teaching Tolerance has lesson plans for students as young as kindergarten that cover bias and social justice.
Historical background
The Graduate Student Coalition for Liberation at The University of Virginia in Charlottesville published a syllabus on Medium that includes primary and secondary historical resources on the local history of segregationism, as well as the urban renewal that displaced African-Americans in the city. There is also background on the dispute over the statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee that was the focal point of the rally this past weekend.
Facing History and Ourselves is an evidence-based social studies curriculum for middle and high school students that grounds discussions of racism and prejudice in students' own moral dilemmas.
American Federation for Teachers president, Randi Weingarten, shared some collections of lesson plans from AFT's Share My Lesson platform: on racial profiling and stereotyping, on civil rights and social justice, on bullying and helping children cope with traumatic events.
Ripped from the headlines
The Atlantic contributing writer Melinda Anderson created the hashtag #CharlottesvilleCurriculum on Twitter to serve as an ongoing list of resources to teach responsively to current events. Sources highlighted include the Equal Justice Initiative and the Citizenship and Social Justice Curriculum.
To help make sense of the news, the Critical Media Project of the University of Southern California offers lesson plans and resources for talking about media literacy as it relates to race, ethnicity and identity.

DENVER (AP) — Taylor Swift won $1 and long-awaited vindication Monday after a jury decided in a civil trial that a radio host groped her during a pre-concert photo op four years ago.
After a weeklong trial over dueling lawsuits, jurors determined that fired Denver DJ David Mueller assaulted the pop star by grabbing her backside during a backstage meet-and-greet. Swift hugged her crying mother after the verdict and reiterated how she wanted to stand up for other women.
“My hope is to help those whose voices should also be heard,” the singer said in a statement, acknowledging her ability to afford attorneys to defend her in court. “Therefore, I will be making donations in the near future to multiple organizations that help sexual assault victims defend themselves.”
The six-woman, two-man jury also found that Swift’s mother and radio liaison were within their rights to contact Mueller’s bosses about the groping.
Mueller sued the Swifts and their radio handler, Frank Bell, seeking up to $3 million for his ruined career. At the end of the trial, the judge dismissed Taylor Swift from Mueller’s lawsuit, saying he failed to prove that she sought to get Mueller fired or had any reason to believe that someone else may have assaulted her.
“I’ve been trying to clear my name for four years,” Mueller said after the verdict. “Civil court is the only option I had. This is the only way that I could be heard.”
The singer-songwriter said in her countersuit that she wanted a symbolic $1.
From the start, Swift’s side portrayed the encounter as a clear case of sexual assault, though they never reported it to police. Her mother tearfully testified that she asked Bell to reach out to Mueller’s employers at country station KYGO-FM instead because they wanted to handle the matter quietly and avoid exposing the singer-songwriter to publicity.
Bell contacted a station vice president and asked for an investigation of Mueller’s conduct. He also sent the station executive a photo taken of Swift, Mueller and Mueller’s then-girlfriend at the meet-and-greet.
In an hourlong stint on the witness stand last week, Swift blasted a low-key characterization by Mueller’s attorney, Gabriel McFarland, of what happened. While Mueller testified he never grabbed Swift, she insisted she was groped.
“He stayed attached to my bare ass-cheek as I lurched away from him,” Swift testified.
“It was a definite grab. A very long grab,” she added.
Mueller emphatically denied reaching under the pop star’s skirt or otherwise touching her inappropriately, insisting he touched only her ribs and may have brushed the outside of her skirt as they awkwardly posed for the picture.
That photo was virtually the evidence besides the testimony. In the image shown to jurors during opening statements but not publicly released, Mueller’s hand is behind Swift, just below her waist. Both are smiling. Mueller’s then-girlfriend is standing on the other side of Swift.
Swift testified that after she was groped, she numbly told Mueller and his girlfriend, “Thank you for coming,” and moved on to photos with others waiting in line because she did not want to disappoint them.
But she said she immediately went to her photographer after the meet-and-greet ended and found the photo of her with Mueller, telling the photographer what happened.
Andrea Swift testified that she asked Bell to call Mueller’s employers. They did not call the police to avoid further traumatizing her daughter, she said.
“We absolutely wanted to keep it private, but we didn’t want him to get away with it,” Andrea Swift testified.
Bell said he emailed the photo to Robert Call, KYGO’s general manager, for use in Call’s investigation of Mueller. He said he didn’t ask that Mueller be fired but that “appropriate action be taken.”
When Javier Duarte stepped down from office last October, the former governor of Mexico's Veracruz state vowed to fight the mounting corruption allegations that unraveled his tenure.
"The circumstances created by false accusations ... force me to dedicate myself full-time to clear my name and that of my family," Duarte said on Oct. 13, according to The Yucatan Times, just one day after he ended his term six weeks early.
Then, Duarte disappeared.
It would be another half-year before the he surfaced — this time in handcuffs, escorted from his hotel at a lakeside resort in Guatemala on Saturday night. Authorities say he had been squirreled away in a hotel room with his wife, attempting to pass as a tourist.
Now he is in a prison cell in Guatemala City, awaiting his widely expected extradition back to Mexico, where Reuters reports he'll face allegations that he diverted public funds for his personal enrichment. That includes a luxury ranch — packed with paintings by masters such as Joan Miro and Leonora Carrington, the BBC reports — that authorities say was paid for by siphoned dollars.
During his roughly six years in office, Duarte's Gulf Coast state also earned the inglorious distinction of becoming "one of the world's most lethal regions for the press," according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. The CPJ estimated last year that at least 12 journalists were murdered during Duarte's tenure; other organizations have placed that number even higher.
A 2012 dispatch from CPJ correspondent Mike O'Connor explains the atmosphere that took shape under Duarte:
"Veracruz is a beautiful, long, thin state on the Gulf coast of Mexico where many journalists are terrified not only of the rampant organized crime groups that kill and control, but also of the state government. Fear that state officials will order them murdered for what they investigate or write has forced about a dozen journalists to flee the state, claiming that fear also puts a clamp on coverage for those who remain."
And that's not to mention the mass grave discovered outside Veracruz city last month that contained 252 bodies, many of which are believed to have been buried years ago.
Strikingly, Duarte's allegation-plagued tenure was by no means uncommon. The politician isn't the only former Mexican governor to draw prosecutors' attention — nor was he the only former leader in his own party, the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, to go on the lam for an extended period.
Former Tamaulipas Gov. Tomás Yarrington was caught in Florence, Italy, just last week after five years on the run. U.S. prosecutors have alleged he "accepted millions of dollars in drug cartel bribes and invested it in Texas real estate," according to The Associated Press. And The Wall Street Journal, citing orders issued by state police, says that Yarrington had been assigned eight law enforcement officers as bodyguards as late as last year.
Meanwhile former Chihuahua Gov. Cesar Duarte — no relation — has still eluded authorities after he stepped down last year. Once a rising star in the PRI like Javier Duarte (who was suspended from the party around the time of his disappearance) and Yarrington, Cesar Duarte is being pursued over embezzlement charges.
All of this makes for a rather persistent problem for the party's leader, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, who has been battling historically terrible approval ratings.
So it's not too much of a surprise that, as the AP reports, the PRI cheered the capture of the former Veracruz governor, who the party said should "be punished in an exemplary fashion, as well as anyone who is confirmed to have taken part in his criminal ring."
Still, it will do little to erase the rather unexemplary records of many governors across Mexico — and not just those in the PRI. The Duartes have plenty of company.
The Los Angeles Times breaks it down: In a country of 31 states and one federal district, nearly a dozen governors recently out of office are on the lam, under investigation or already in prison.
BERLIN (AP) — A 20-year-old German man has been convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison for killing a child and a 22-year-old acquaintance.
News agency dpa reported Wednesday that the Bochum state court chose to sentence the defendant as an adult, though it could have judged him under milder juvenile law.
Marcel Hesse, through his lawyer, admitted during his trial to the two killings. In March, he allegedly lured a 9-year-old neighbor out of his home in the western city of Herne and then stabbed him. The discovery of the body prompted a three-day manhunt before Hesse turned himself in.
Police later found the body of a former school friend of Hesse's at a nearby apartment, while pictures of the crimes, allegedly posted by Hesse, surfaced online.
The motive remains unclear.
RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) — The community college student with a page-boy haircut was quiet, never drew attention to himself and earned A's semester after semester.
Despite ample opportunities, he apparently never divulged the sickening truth that his home was a veritable torture chamber.
Authorities say the student, now about 26, was the eldest male among 13 siblings who were held captive in their California home by their parents, David and Louise Turpin.
The couple starved all but their 2-year-old daughter for years and sometimes chained their children to beds for months at a time without letting them use the toilet, prosecutors said.
However, Louise Turpin regularly drove her oldest son to classes at the nearby Menifee campus of Mt. San Jacinto College and waited outside the classroom for him.
He was on the president's honor roll in fall 2015 and spring 2016, college spokeswoman Karin Marriott said.
A transcript obtained by ABC News showed he attended classes from 2014 until at least 2016 and took up to 15 credits a semester. He earned A's in many classes, including algebra, guitar, public speaking, English fundamentals and freshman composition.
A classmate, Marci Duncker, said he was "always quiet and alone" when they attended classes. She tried to say hello to him a few times but he just looked at her and never responded.
"It was one of the most sad faces I'd seen in years," Duncker said.
The boy was usually one of the last people to leave class, she said.
None of the names of the abused siblings have been released by authorities and all were taken to hospitals when they were freed two weeks ago from the home in Perris, about 70 miles (113 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles.
Authorities say the abuse was so long-running their growth was stunted.
Despite near-daily interactions with others outside the home, there's no indication the oldest son ever sought to draw attention to what was happening at home. Gale Kelley, a trainer for the International Association of Trauma Professionals, said that reluctance is understandable.
"They were born into this. This was normal for them. Some of them may not even realize they've been abused," she said. "These children have been living in isolation so they only know what they know."
Abusers often tell children they shouldn't talk about what happens at home or that they deserve to be treated that way, and that may have made it difficult for them to escape, she said.
"We don't know what kind of duress they were under as far as threats," Kelley said. "They're still seeing the world through the eyes of a scared little kid who is in constant danger."
The case has drawn international attention and compassion for the children.
The younger ones were home-schooled and there's no evidence the other older children were educated outside the home, except for the oldest girl — now 29 — who had attended kindergarten to third grade in a public school in Texas.
Sheriff's deputies rescued the children on Jan. 14 after the Turpins' 17-year-old daughter climbed out a window and called 911.
The house reeked of human waste and evidence of starvation was obvious, with the oldest sibling weighing only 82 pounds, Riverside County District Attorney Mike Hestrin said.
The parents were arrested and pleaded not guilty to torture and other charges.
The siblings, seven adults and six children, will likely need years of therapy, psychological experts said, adding that if possible it would be best to keep them together for now.
"They're going to have some developmental delays, no question," said Russell Rice, a family therapist and executive director of a California residential treatment program for teenagers in Redlands. "Their brains are going to be as stunted if not more than their physical development."
Rice said more independent options exist, for example, a residential complex with a case manager on site to assist with money management or other programs. But he said that could be overwhelming for people who have been sheltered from the outside world.
"They don't even know how to shop, probably, and the concept of money," he said. "They won't be living on their own. They'll be highly supervised for quite some time."
The repeated exposure to traumatic events could make them skittish when they are out in public.
"The children have been in constant crisis mode, constant danger, and so that switch gets turned and it is always on," Kelley said. "They're expecting to see trauma everywhere and in everybody."

OXON HILL, Md. (AP) — The dramatic final rounds of the Scripps National Spelling Bee are set to begin.
Forty-one spellers advanced to Thursday's finals out of a field of 516 — by far the largest in the 93-year history of the competition. Scripps started a wild-card program this year that created a path to nationals for spellers who didn't win their regional bees, and some of the finalists got to the bee that way.
The past 13 champions and 18 of the last 22 have been Indian-American, and that trend could easily continue. Most of the consensus favorites in this year's bee have Indian heritage.

As per Rule # 3, ligature will be rendered. ZWJ and ZWNJ characters are used to produce alternate rendering of ligature.
A consonant followed by ZWJ character will produce half-formed consonant character.
Example
প্রশ্ন = prashn
প্রশ্‍ন = prash^n
A consonant followed by ZWNJ character will produce dead consonant character.
Example
প্রশ্ন = prashn
প্রশ্‌ন = prash^^n
If two english characters are making one Bengali Vowel (i.e. ai, au), then
ZWJ character is used to separate them into two different vowels. It will not
add ZWJ character but only considered as the separator between two
vowels.
They didn't wear hoods as they chanted "Jews will not replace us." They weren't hiding their faces as they waved Confederate flags, racist signs and swastikas. They looked straight at a sea of cameras as they made the Nazi salute.
As Matt Thompson wrote for The Atlantic, the white supremacist march and rally this past weekend wasn't a KKK rally: "It was a pride march."
The bare-faced shamelessness was the point. But it was also an opening.
On the Internet, some people are crowd-sourcing efforts to identify and shame the people participating in the rally. Most prominently, on Twitter, the account called "Yes, You're Racist" has been soliciting help and posting IDs. "I'll make them famous," the account pledged.
So far, at least one protester is no longer employed after being publicly named and shamed.
Cole White, who used to work at a hot dog restaurant in Berkeley, Calif., "voluntarily resigned" on Saturday after his employer confronted him about his participation in the event, according to the Berkeleyside news site.
@YesYoureRacist is not a new Twitter account. Since 2012, the account has been calling out "casual racism on Twitter," according to the user's fundraising page. It would post screenshots of deleted racist tweets, highlight offensive comments by elected officials and retweet everyday users who would say "I'm not racist but ..." followed by something, well, racist.
But after the rally in Charlottesville, Yes You're Racist pivoted from highlighting online remarks to identifying real-world marchers.
Many of the people it named had publicly declared their plans to go to Charlottesville. The account identified one man as "Illegal Aryan," who wrote on the white supremacist site Daily Stormer last month, "See you in Charlottesville!"
"Illegal Aryan," real name Mark Daniel Reardon, was identified by an antifascist group this spring and confirmed on Daily Stormer that he lost his job as a result.
Another identified marcher, who has repeatedly tweeted holocaust denials and says he is a member of the Proud Boys, said on Twitter he was at Charlottesville. After he was identified, he said he's received death threats.
Of course, there's a long and not entirely noble tradition of online humiliation for perceived moral trespasses.
Jon Ronson, who literally wrote the book on the phenomenon (it's called So You've Been Publicly Shamed), chimed in on Twitter to give his take on the public identification of the white supremacists, white nationalists and neo-Nazis marching in Charlottesville.
"They were undisguised in a massively contentious rally surrounded by the media," he said, noting also that there's "a big difference" between making a thoughtless or offensive comment online and marching in the name of white power.
That said, Twitter is "a terrible information swapping service," he said, and some innocent people would inevitably get caught up in the process.
Indeed, the "Yes You're Racist" account has made, and acknowledged, some mistakes.
One of the photos it examined was from a previous Trump rally, not the Charlottesville march or rally. (That image featured a man wearing a Nazi armband. He said on Youtube he wore it as a "social experiment" to prove that "not all Trump supporters are Nazis. I went to the Trump rally as a Nazi and they kicked me out and disavowed me ... I dressed up as a Nazi to prove a point, not to spread a message of hate.")
Another photo was misidentified as the white supremacist Billy Roper. Roper, who has called for non-white races to be "eliminated" or "become extinct," did not actually attend the Charlottesville event. Roper, who is vehemently anti-Semitic, objected to the fact that one of the speakers at the event works with a Jewish fundraiser.
Roper wrote on his blog that he actively contributed to the confusion over the identity of the "Arkansas Engineering" marcher:
"Early on in the game, I decided to troll them by alternately confirming then denying that I was the person in the picture, in order to confuse the trail and distract them from the guy they were after. So, I spent the better part of the evening schooling some and gaming others."
As Roper muddied the waters, others on the Internet misidentified the man in the photo as a University of Arkansas professor, which was false.
Meanwhile, one young man who was photographed screaming at the torchlit march told a local news station that it was definitely him — but he insisted he's "not the angry racist" people see in the photo.
"As a white nationalist, I care for all people," said Peter Cvjetanovic, who is studying history and political science at the University of Nevada, Reno.
"I did not expect the photo to be shared as much as it was," he told KTVN.
A "Yes, You're Racist" tweet about Peter Cvjetanovic was retweeted more than 32,000 times.

KAZAN, Russia (AP) — Four years after Brazil's humiliation at its home World Cup, Thiago Silva is back to his best in Russia, a country where his then-burgeoning career was almost tragically cut short years ago.
The 33-year-old Brazil center back — who is nicknamed "O Monstro" for his exceptional physical abilities — is probably playing in his final World Cup, and he has been enjoying a perfect tournament so far.
While forward Neymar attracted negative comments for his antics on the field, Silva has been irreproachable. The captain arguably has been the best center back of the tournament, alongside Uruguay captain Diego Godin.
Like Uruguay, Brazil has conceded only one goal in Russia so far, from a set piece in its opening 1-1 draw with Switzerland . And the Selecao's rivals have managed only five shots on target in their four matches against the five-time champions.
Silva has been playing a key role in helping Brazil achieve those impressive statistics, anchoring the defense with authority and class. During the 2-0 win against Mexico that guaranteed Brazil advanced to the quarterfinals for the seventh consecutive time, Silva was decisive both in the air and on the ground, blocked several shots and made two clearances.
"It's a huge joy to be doing an excellent cup and to be growing with every game," Silva said. "I'm happy about my performance, and the performance of the team."
Happiness and joy have been hard to come by during some stretches of Silva's career.
The native of Rio de Janeiro went through hard times after Brazil's 7-1 loss to Germany at the last World Cup. Silva did not play in that game because he was suspended, but he was harshly criticized and branded a cry baby for his emotional outbursts as he was pictured in tears before a penalty shootout against Chile in the round of 16.
After the tournament, he was stripped of the team's captaincy by new coach Dunga, then left off the regular roster after the 2015 Copa America. He returned from exile in September 2016 for World Cup qualifiers after being called up by Dunga's successor, Tite.
Those professional ups and downs are nothing compared to the ordeal Silva went through back in 2005, when he spent about six months in a Moscow hospital after he contracted tuberculosis. Regarded at the time as one of the world's most promising defenders, Silva had been sent on loan from Porto to Dynamo Moscow alongside several teammates.
"It was probably the worst episode of my life," Silva said.
It was during a training camp in Portugal that doctor Yuri Vassilkov, who had traveled along with the team, noticed that Silva had a persistent cough.
"He had temperature and we thought it was a simple cold," Vassilkov said in an interview with L'Equipe newspaper this week. "I gave him some medication but he did not improve. I was a bit worried and I sent him for exams at the British hospital in Lisbon. The diagnosis was terrible: tuberculosis. It was a shock."
Vassilkov believes that the diagnosis was so late that Silva was weeks away from dying.
Silva was brought back to Moscow, where he was hospitalized in a center specializing in tuberculosis treatment. At the time, Silva did not speak English or Russian and went through a bout of depression.
"The cold, the lack of natural light, the fact that I could not speak to anybody ... All this was very difficult to handle," Silva remembered in an interview with Belgian Sport/Foot magazine.
After Russian doctors at one point considered removing part of his lungs, Silva survived and fully recovered. He never played a game for Dynamo, and these painful events are just bad memories now.
"That would have ended my career. I needed guardian angels to take me away," Silva said. "I was a bit overwhelmed in a friendly we played against Russia this year. It is different for me to play there. I hope I can erase that by lifting the World Cup trophy."

A 23-year-old, Russian-born violinist named Artem Kolesov is capturing international attention after posting a YouTube video in which he comes out as gay.
The son of two Pentecostal pastors in a small town an hour away from Moscow, Kolesov says that he has struggled for most of his life to reconcile his sexual orientation with his Christian beliefs and his family's views. "In my family," Kolesov says in his video, "I often heard that all gays should be destroyed, that they should be bombed, and that if anyone in our family turns out to be gay, my family should kill them with their bare hands."
In the video, Kolesov also recounts wrenching episodes from throughout his life. At age seven, he prayed that he would die before his mother found out that he liked boys. He also endured physical and sexual abuse from one of his brothers, who threatened to out him to his parents if Kolesov told anyone about the abuse, and later attempted suicide several times.
Growing up, he says, "I never heard anything good about gay people. All I knew was that gays are the people who everyone should hate. I was scared because I knew that I was gay. I didn't know anyone who I could talk to about it. It seemed that I was the only gay person in Russia."
The violinist made his video as part of the Russian "Children-404" project, which invites teenagers to share their stories and discuss LGBT issues in Russia. In most of their photos and videos, participants shield their identities by holding up a "Children-404" sign in front of their faces.
Instead of creating an anonymous contribution, Kolesov chose to share his name and face, to let fellow LGBT youth in Russia feel less isolated. He recorded the video in Russian, but also provided English subtitles. "We don't come out for heterosexual people to know," he says in his video, which he published on March 29. "We don't come out for the ones who hate us to know. We shout and make as much noise as possible just so other people like us who are scared and can't be themselves would know that they are not a mistake and they are not alone."
Formerly based in Canada, Kolesov now lives in Chicago, where he is first violinist in the Yas Quartet, which is in residence at Roosevelt University's Chicago College of Performing Arts. Last summer, his ensemble took third prize in the Chamber Division at the Schoenfeld International String Competition which was held in Harbin, China.
In his video, Kolesov contrasts his family's pleasure in his musical accomplishments with their reaction to his coming out. "They are ashamed to have a gay son and brother," he says. "They wish that this part of my identity didn't exist. Interesting that my family is proud of me for being a violinist, and is so ashamed of me for being gay, though both of these are parts of my identity."
In the aftermath of releasing his video, Kolesov told BuzzFeed that he's already begun to experience the impact of his decision to come out so publicly. He has received many positive messages from friends and strangers alike, but he said that he is afraid of being arrested if he returns to Russia, under enforcement of a vaguely worded but broad "anti-gay propaganda" law. Earlier this month, there were reports that more than 100 gay men in Chechnya were arrested and tortured, with some of them reportedly killed by police. (Authorities have denied both the arrests and the deaths.)
Kolesov is also not currently on speaking terms with his relatives, and told BuzzFeed, "Even if I go back to Russia, I'm not sure I would be feeling completely safe with my own family."

TAIPEI (Taiwan News)—The 2018 Waimushan (外木山) sea swimming race in Taiwan's northern port city of Keelung will take place on June 10, and registration for the race is open from now to May 4, the organizer of the event, Keelung City Government, announced on Tuesday.
The annual sea swimming event had been held consecutively for 11 years until last year when it was canceled due to the impact of heavy rains.
The swim will start from Hai Xing Pool (海興游泳池) and end at the Dawulun Beach (大武崙海灘), covering a total distance of 3,200 meters.
Keelung City Government said only groups of three or more people and online registration will be accepted and that only people older than 10 years are eligible to participate. The registration fee is NT$600 (US$20) each, the organizer added.
As the entry limit is 3,000 persons, the registration may end earlier when the total number is full, said Keelung Mayor Lin Yu- chang (林右昌), who also stated that he will participate in the race this year.

Building a slide deck, pitch, or presentation? Here are the big takeaways:
Business professionals could gain from wearing a wearable device, but some have more fitness features than business features.
Professionals should look for wearables with different ways to stay connected, basic activity tracking, and a fashion-forward look.
Wearables, like smartwatches and fitness trackers, are popular with business professionals, and for good reason. The devices can collect data and provide insights, allowing wearers to track their fitness and productivity to reach their goals faster.
But some devices may not work the best for business professionals. They may not have enough ways to stay connected in terms of communications, or they may be too focused on physical goals like meditation. And some may stand out too much for professionals in formal business attire to feel comfortable wearing them.
SEE: Wearable Device Policy (Tech Pro Research)
How to choose a wearable for business
Connectivity is the first thing to consider when selecting a wearable for business purposes. Some options can connect to a smartphone, while others work outside of a cellular network. Some professionals need constant access to business communication, and selecting a wearable that works in tandem with a smartphone can provide that.
Think about what you want to accomplish with your wearable. Do you want to just be able to see notifications, or do you need to be able to answer texts and emails as well? What about activity tracking? It can help you understand how you spend your hours to find ways to become more productive, or you can use it for fitness purposes as well.
Apps and integrations can be helpful for business professionals, so check out what is available. Some, especially ones connected to a smartphone, have multiple options, while others have fewer choices. Integrations can streamline things between your wearable and other devices, potentially making you more efficient. Apps can offer new ways to boost productivity.
Mindfulness features are also helpful, especially in high-stress jobs or industries. A sleep tracker can help understand if you're sleeping long or well enough.
Finally, looks aren't everything, but some wearables can stand out when worn with business attire. More wearables are adopting the look of traditional watches, with leather bands and sleek faces. A wearable won't do much if you don't wear it because of its look.
How to choose a wearable for fitness
First, you should consider if you want one device to carry from work to the gym, or if you want separate options. Some popular devices, like the Apple Watch, can work for both environments due to the amount of features and connectivity options.
Much like with business wearables, you need to consider what exactly the fitness tracker needs to do. Most will offer the same baseline metrics, but others offer more analytics. How much insight do you want into your workouts? Some only need simple step tracking, but someone training for a marathon may need more detail.
In what physical environment are you going to use the device? Whatever the answer, the tracker should be ready. For example, if you're a swimmer, you obviously need a water-resistant device. Runners may want a device with a built-in GPS so they can track their runs.
You should also consider the tracker's connected app, if it has one. What analysis and insights can you get on the app? Does it have features to track food and water intake? Like with business wearables, integrations may also be important, so review the offerings.

Friend of San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook pleads guilty to providing him with the rifles used in the attack.
A friend of Syed Farook, the shooter who carried out the San Bernardino terror attack in December of 2015, has agreed to plead guilty to providing the high-powered rifles used to kill 14 people and injure nearly two dozen others, The Associated Press reported Tuesday.
Enrique Marquez Jr., 25, of Riverside, admitted in a plea agreement that he bought the assault rifles used by Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, in the December 2, 2015, attack.
Farook and Malik were later killed in a gunfight with authorities. Marquez was the only man to be criminally charged in the shooting.
Marquez also agreed to plead guilty to making false statements when he purchased the firearms used in the attack, according to AP.
Marquez was arrested two weeks after the attack. Police said at the time they believed he purchased the weapons on behalf of Farook, who did not want them traced to him and feared he would not pass a background check.
Shortly after the massacre, the FBI raided Marquez’s Riverside home.
Prosecutors said Marquez acknowledged being a "straw buyer" when he purchased two AR-15 rifles from a sporting goods store that were used in the attack at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino.
The prosecutors stressed there is no evidence Marquez himself participated in the San Bernardino massacre or had advance knowledge of it.
Marquez also admitted to plotting with Farook in 2011 and 2012 to massacre college students and gun down motorists on a gridlocked California freeway, though those attacks never occurred.
The FBI said after the massacre that Farook and Malik were both radicalized "for quite some time" and had taken target practice at Los Angeles-area shooting ranges, and once "within days" of the shooting.
It is believed Farook had contact with people from at least two terrorist organizations overseas, and investigators have also said Malik had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (ISIS) group in a Facebook posting before the shooting attack.
Marquez, who could face up to 25 years in prison, is scheduled to appear before a federal judge on Thursday, according to AP. His attorney didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment.

PODGORICA, Montenegro (AP) — Police in Montenegro say they have picked up 17 migrants, including 11 Syrians, from an Italian fishing boat that sent a distress signal off the Montenegrin coast.
The police ship's crew said Tuesday they picked up the migrants from a small inflatable boat floating in the Adriatic sea. Police say two Moroccans, two people from Yemen, one from Afghanistan and one from Pakistan were also on the boat. The group included four children.
It was not immediately clear where the migrants started their journey.
Montenegro has been largely spared from the migrant flow across the Balkans that peaked in 2016, with people fleeing wars and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia trying to reach the Western Europe.
Israel downgrades ties with Senegal, New Zealand Israel reportedly downgrades ties with New Zealand, Senegal over UN anti-settlement resolution Contact Editor JTA,
Reuters United Nations Security Council Israel is permanently downgrading its diplomatic ties with New Zealand and Senegal, two of the co-sponsors of an anti-settlement resolution passed in the United Nations, according to an Israeli newspaper report.
According to a "senior source," Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu decided last week not to return the two ambassadors.
Israel recalled the ambassadors after Resolution 2334 passed in late December. The resolution passed by a vote of 14-0 with one abstention, the United States.
According to the report, not returning resident ambassadors to the country is not a formal demotion of ties, but relying on a charge d'affairs in the two countries effectively downgrades the ties.
Netanyahu reportedly ordered a halt to Israeli aid to Senegal in the wake of the resolution's passage.
Venezuela and Malaysia were the resolution's other two co-sponsors.
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The man accused of fatally shooting a woman and wounding six people at a Tennessee church in September faces a 43-count indictment, including first-degree murder, attempted murder and felony civil rights intimidation charges.
Friday's grand jury indictment in Davidson County charges 26-year-old Emanuel Kidega Samson in the Burnette Chapel Church of Christ shooting in Nashville. He's been held without bond since September.
An arrest affidavit from September says Samson waived his rights and told police he arrived armed and fired at Burnette.
In October, Nashville Police Detective Steve Jolley testified that a note in Samson's car referred to a white supremacist's 2015 massacre at a South Carolina black church. Jolley said Samson also told him he didn't give much thought to race or religion, and heard voices and had visions.

The autistic student had a full-time one-on-one aide because he was known to be violent, the lawsuit filed Monday said. The aide was asleep when the 2012 attack happened during Pearl City High School band practice, the lawsuit said. The Associated Press doesn’t typically name victims of sexual assault. The 10th-grade girl was in the back of the band at the percussion section when the larger 11th-grader raped her there and then again in a curtained area of the auditorium. The aide was sleeping in the audience section of the auditorium, the lawsuit said. State Department of Education spokeswoman Donalyn Dela Cruz declined to comment on pending litigation. Kyle Miyashiro, who was a vice principal at the time and is named as a defendant, referred questions to the school’s principal who didn’t immediately respond Tuesday. The aide, Bryan Simpson, is also named as a defendant and no longer works at the school, Miyashiro said. Simpson couldn’t be reached for comment. The girl reported the rape to her mother and police, said her attorney Peter Hsieh. The autistic student was prosecuted in family court and convicted of two counts of first-degree sexual assault, Hsieh said. “She dropped out of high school. She couldn’t finish because of what happened to her,” Hsieh said. But she later earned a GED diploma and is now studying bioengineering at the University of Hawaii, he said. “She’s basically turned an adverse situation as a motivator for her,” he said, adding that it was her decision to pursue a civil lawsuit. In a separate, similar case, a jury last year determined that the Department of Education failed to protect a special education student who said she was raped by a special education classmate at Waianae High School. The jury awarded the girl and her mother about $810,000 in damages, but the state appealed. The case is before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, said Hsieh, who also handled that case. The two lawsuits send a “loud message that there is a lack of proper training and supervision of teachers, aides and assistants,” Hsieh said, “especially when it comes to children who have a history of violence.” — Follow Jennifer Sinco Kelleher at http://www.twitter.com/JenHapa.

Diamondbacks ace Zack Greinke will start this season in the dugout.
Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said Monday that Greinke won't pitch on opening day because of what's perceived to be a minor health issue.
Greinke exited his latest start after one inning because of tightness in his groin. He's scheduled to pitch again in spring training Wednesday.
The Diamondbacks don't want to push him to be ready for their first game March 29 at home against Colorado. Without this wrinkle, Lovullo said Greinke would've started the opener for the third straight year.
"Every staff has a No. 1 and he fit the bill perfectly," Lovullo said. "He won 17 games last year. He was our staff ace."
Lovullo said he wasn't ready to say who would start against the Rockies. The likely candidate is Robbie Ray, who went 15-5 with a 2.89 ERA last year.
"There's a strategy," Lovullo said. "We don't just look at opening day. We look at opening day and then beyond, so probably five or six days beyond that day. And we want to make sure that we hit things just right to get it to the point where we have good matchups all the way through."

BEIRUT (AP) — The Latest on the war in Syria, Turkey's offensive against the Syrian Kurdish militia in the enclave of Afrin and (all times local):
11:20 a.m.
A Russian diplomat says the opening of a Russia-sponsored peace conference for Syria is being delayed.
Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi is hosting the conference that Moscow describes as an effort to speed up political settlement for the war-torn country.
Russia, a key ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad, says it invited 1,600 representatives to the Syrian Congress of National Dialogue, but so far only the government and opposition representatives tolerated by it have shown up. The main Syrian opposition body has boycotted the talks.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Artyom Kozhin told Russian news agencies on Tuesday that the conference is being delayed but "will start soon."
He confirmed earlier reports of some members of the rebel groups returning to the airport in protest. Kozhin says the Turkish foreign minister assured the Russian foreign minister on the phone earlier this morning that the "matter will be settled."
The Sochi gathering has been overshadowed by reports of intense clashes that erupted on Monday on a strategic hilltop in northwestern Syria as Kurdish forces tried to enter the area a day after it was captured by Turkish troops.
___
10:15 a.m.
Turkey's state-run news agency says senior members of a medical association who spoke out against Ankara's military offensive in a Syrian Kurdish enclave have been detained.
Anadolu Agency says the chief of the Turkish Medical Association and seven others were detained in Tuesday's police operations for breach of Turkey's anti-terror laws. It says prosecutors issued warrants for 11 members of the association.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused association members of being "terrorist lovers" and his government has cracked down on criticism of the offensive. Turkey considers the Kurdish militia it is fighting in Syria an extension of the outlawed Kurdish rebels inside Turkey.
As many as 311 people were detained in the past week for allegedly engaging in "terrorist propaganda" through social media postings critical of the military operation.
Prime Minister Theresa May has announced a snap general election.
There was anticipation over the unexpected statement outside Downing Street, which is only used for major announcements.
She will now need to get the backing of two thirds of MPs in the House of Commons tomorrow, Wednesday, to overturn the Fixed Term Parliament Act meaning the next General Election must be 2020.
The Prime Minister used to a statement in Downing Street to set out the case for going back on her previous pledge there would be no election ahead of 2020.
Mrs May said the lack of “unity” in Westminster over the Brexit process was weakening the Government’s negotiating hand with Brussels and meant an election was required.
“We need a General Election and we need one now,” she said.
Explaining the timing, Mrs May said it would coincide with the European Union leaders finalising their Brexit negotiating position and come before full talks begin.
Under the terms of the Fixed Term Parliament Act, MPs will have to vote for an early election in Parliament tomorrow.
Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said: “This election is your chance to change the direction of our country.
“If you want to avoid a disastrous Hard Brexit. If you want to keep Britain in the Single Market. If you want a Britain that is open, tolerant and united, this is your chance.
“Only the Liberal Democrats can prevent a Conservative majority.”
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he welcomed Mrs May’s announcement because it gave “the British people the chance to vote for a government that will put the interests of the majority first”.
“Labour will be offering the country an effective alternative to a Government that has failed to rebuild the economy, delivered falling living standards and damaging cuts to our schools and NHS. In the last couple of weeks, Labour has set out policies that offer a clear and credible choice for the country. We look forward to showing how Labour will stand up for the people of Britain.”

Technavio has published a new market research report on the global iron oxide pigments market from 2018-2022. (Graphic: Business Wire)
Increasing demand for nano-iron oxide pigments is a key trend which is expected to impact the market outlook over the forecast period. Leading vendors are increasingly investing in R&D to capture a large proportion of market shares through new product introductions. The incorporation of potential materials such as nanoparticles in coatings and other technologies is a relatively new concept in the market. The demand for nano-sized iron oxide pigments is increasing in the construction, coating, and cosmetics end-user industries.

In this report, Technavio analysts highlight increasing offshore exploration and production investments as a key factor contributing to the growth of the global iron oxide pigments market:
Increasing offshore exploration and production investments
The increase in the demand for energy and the depletion of onshore reserves have made oil and gas companies invest significantly in offshore oil and gas reserves. The rising drilling activities and the high demand from the offshore rigs and floating production storage and offloading are likely to foster the demand for iron oxide pigments. These pigments are used as lubricants in oil drilling rigs and as catalysts in the petroleum industry.
Increasing offshore activities and construction projects are fueling the consumption of oil and gas, thereby driving the demand for iron oxide pigments. Moreover, these iron-based automotive coatings are widely used in OEM components such as cylinder heads, crankcases, transmission housings, engine blocks, pumps, bearings, suspension systems, bodywork parts, and wheels (with both exterior and interior furnishings).
“Also, the increased demand for automotive coatings is expected to drive the global iron oxide pigments market during the forecast period. Different types of iron oxide pigments (based on the particle size) are used, including micaceous, opaque, and transparent pigments. These transparent iron oxide pigments are widely used, owing to their various benefits such as the reduction in the coloring cost, improved transparency, UV absorption, and color consistency,” says a senior analyst at Technavio for research.

Global iron oxide pigments market segmentation
This market research report segments the by product (synthetic iron oxide pigments and natural iron oxide pigments), by end-user (construction, paints and coatings, foundry, industrial chemicals, and others) and key regions (APAC, Europe, North America, and ROW).
Of the four major end-user segments, the construction segment held the largest market share in 2017, accounting for over 53% of the market, followed by the paints and coatings segment.
In terms of geography, APAC held the largest market share accounting for close to 45%, followed by Europe, North America, and ROW. Also, APAC is expected to emerge as the only region that will witness a growth in its market share over the forecast period. The market share of all the other three regions is expected to dip by 2022.

ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr 24, 2018--The Coca-Cola Company’s start to 2018 built on prior momentum, with strong financial performance in the first quarter. While reported net revenues continued to be impacted by refranchising, the company delivered organic revenue (non-GAAP) and volume growth across all geographic operating groups. The company gained value share globally, in addition to seeing improved trends across the beverage industry overall.
This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180424005748/en/
"We’re encouraged with our first quarter performance as we continue our evolution as a consumer-centric, total beverage company," said James Quincey, President and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company. "We have the right strategies in place and remain confident in our ability to achieve our full year guidance."
During the first quarter, the company expanded its portfolio and continued to drive revenue growth. The company’s unit case volume grew 3% with an acceleration in smaller, immediate consumption packaging as revenue growth management initiatives were successfully executed in the market. The company’s portfolio continued to evolve and expand through world-class innovation, expansion of the lift, shift and scale model and bolt-on M&A, anchored by continued strength in core brands. These disciplined growth strategies, underpinned by a stronger and aligned system along with a winning culture, helped to drive the business forward.
Highlights
Quarterly Performance
Revenues: Net revenues declined 16% to $7.6 billion for the quarter, impacted by a 26% headwind from refranchising of bottling territories. Organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 5% for the quarter, driven by concentrate sales growth of 4% and price/mix growth of 1%. Volume: Total unit case volume grew 3%, with growth across all category clusters and geographic operating groups. Trademark Coca-Cola was the largest contributor, with a clear acceleration in all brands under the trademark. Margin: Operating margin, which included items impacting comparability, grew over 220 basis points. Comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) expanded 600 basis points, driven by divestitures of lower-margin bottling businesses and the company’s ongoing productivity efforts, partially offset by the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard. Market Share: The company continued to gain value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink ("NARTD") beverages. Cash Flow: Cash from operations for the quarter was $613 million, down 20% primarily due to the refranchising of North American bottling territories and the impact of one less day in the quarter. Free cash flow (non-GAAP) was $339 million, up 5% driven by reduced capital investment needs. Share Repurchases: Purchases of stock for treasury for the quarter were $927 million. Net share repurchases (non-GAAP) totaled $471 million.
Company Updates
Leveraging the strength of leader brands: The company continued to capitalize on its leadership position in sparkling soft drinks. A consistent focus on the One Brand Strategy for Trademark Coca-Cola led to 4% volume growth, fueled by 3% growth in brand Coca-Cola and double-digit growth in Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. This performance, along with driving profitability within sparkling through revenue growth management initiatives, led to 6% growth in global retail value for Trademark Coca-Cola. Expanding presence in on-trend categories: After the recent acquisition of the U.S. rights to Topo Chico premium sparkling mineral water, the company was able to extend the brand’s reach through increased distribution, while preserving its strong heritage. The brand grew its U.S. retail value over 30% during the quarter and gained value share in the fast-growing sparkling water category. Innovation within iconic brands: Diet Coke returned to volume growth in North America during the quarter, following a full brand restage. The introduction of four bold, new flavors, along with contemporary, sleek packaging and innovative marketing, helped lift the performance of the brand. Scaling successful brands rapidly: During the quarter, the company leveraged its strength in distribution to lift, shift and scale leading brands around the world. Fuze Tea, which was already available in 49 countries, was introduced in an additional 37 countries across Europe, featuring new herb and fruit-infused flavors with fewer calories. The single-day launch of Fuze Tea in Europe was executed on a scale that was unprecedented in the company’s history.
In addition to the data in the preceding tables, operating results included the following:
Consolidated
Price/mix grew 1% in the quarter as solid pricing in the marketplace was partially offset by timing. Concentrate sales grew ahead of unit case volume, largely due to the timing of shipments, particularly in the emerging markets. Unit case volume grew 3% for the quarter. Category cluster performance was as follows: Sparkling soft drinks: 4%Juice, dairy and plant-based beverages: 3%Water, enhanced water and sports drinks: 1%Tea and coffee: 5% Operating income was impacted by comparability items, predominantly charges associated with the refranchising of bottling territories in North America. Results were also impacted by structural items related to refranchising. Growth in comparable currency neutral operating income (adjusted for structural items and accounting changes) (non-GAAP) was driven by organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth and the benefit from ongoing productivity initiatives.
Europe, Middle East & Africa
Price/mix declined 1% for the quarter, as positive pricing in the marketplace was offset by negative geographic mix due to growth in emerging and developing markets outpacing developed markets. Concentrate sales grew 5 points ahead of unit case volume due to the timing of shipments in the majority of business units. Unit case volume grew 4% in the quarter, led by strong performance in Turkey and South Africa, partially offset by declines in Nigeria and Western Europe. Operating income growth trailed revenue growth, largely due to a less favorable currency impact to operating income compared to revenue in addition to increased marketing investments related to the Fuze Tea launch. Product mix also impacted the quarter due to continued strong growth in innocent, a finished goods business. The company gained value share in the juice, dairy and plant-based beverages cluster.
Latin America
Price/mix growth of 6% for the quarter was primarily driven by strong price/mix in Mexico and the South Latin business unit. Unit case volume grew 1% in the quarter, as low to mid single-digit growth in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico was partially offset by declines in Peru and Chile. Operating income growth during the quarter was driven by solid pricing in the marketplace in addition to productivity initiatives. The company gained or maintained value share in sparkling soft drinks as well as the juice, dairy and plant-based beverages and water, enhanced water and sports drink clusters.
North America
Price/mix declined 1% for the quarter as low single-digit underlying pricing was offset by the cycling of certain product launches, incremental freight costs, and the timing of the Easter holiday. Unit case volume grew 2% for the quarter. Sparkling soft drinks growth of 3% included double-digit growth in Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, along with positive performance in Diet Coke. Juice, dairy and plant-based beverages declined 2%, as growth in dairy and plant-based beverages was offset by a decline in juice, largely due to deprioritizing lower-margin juice drink brands and to package re-sizing across the juice portfolio. Tea and coffee grew 5%. Water, enhanced water and sports drinks grew 1%, which included strong growth in the sparkling water portfolio driven by double-digit growth in smartwater sparkling and Dasani sparkling, in addition to the strong performance of Topo Chico. Operating income for the quarter was unfavorably impacted by a 6-point headwind from cycling the benefit of intercompany profit elimination in the prior year related to the refranchising of North American bottling operations. The company gained or maintained value share in total NARTD beverages, along with all category clusters.
Asia Pacific
Price/mix declined 2% for the quarter, largely driven by negative geographic mix as growth in China and India outpaced more developed markets, including Japan and Australia. Unit case volume growth of 5% for the quarter was driven by strong performance in China and India, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in Southeast Asia. Operating income growth outpaced revenue growth for the quarter, largely driven by favorable product mix as sparkling soft drinks grew volume double digits in China and India. The company gained or maintained value share in total NARTD beverages along with sparkling soft drinks and the juice, dairy and plant-based beverages cluster.
Bottling Investments
Price/mix growth of 2% for the quarter was largely driven by strong performance in India. The operating loss for the quarter was largely driven by items impacting comparability. Comparable currency neutral operating loss (non-GAAP) was unfavorably impacted by the refranchising of North American bottling territories and the deconsolidation of previously held bottling operations in China.
Outlook
The 2018 outlook information provided below includes forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, which management uses in measuring performance. The company is not able to reconcile full year 2018 projected organic revenues (non-GAAP) to full year 2018 projected reported net revenues, full year 2018 projected comparable currency neutral operating income (adjusted for structural items and accounting changes) (non-GAAP) to full year 2018 projected reported operating income, or full year 2018 projected comparable EPS from continuing operations (non-GAAP) to full year 2018 projected reported EPS from continuing operations without unreasonable efforts because it is not possible to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates; the exact timing and amount of acquisitions, divestitures and/or structural changes; the exact timing and amount of comparability items throughout 2018; and the actual impact of accounting changes.

Notes
All references to growth rate percentages and share compare the results of the period to those of the prior year comparable period. All references to volume and volume percentage changes indicate unit case volume, unless otherwise noted. All volume percentage changes are computed based on average daily sales, unless otherwise noted. "Unit case" means a unit of measurement equal to 24 eight-ounce servings of finished beverage. "Unit case volume" means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverages directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners to customers. "Core business" represents the combined performance from the Europe, Middle East & Africa; Latin America; North America; Asia Pacific; and Corporate operating segments offset by intersegment eliminations. "Concentrate sales" represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, beverage bases, source waters, and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the company to its bottling partners or other customers. In the reconciliation of reported net revenues, "concentrate sales" represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for the geographic operating segments (expressed in equivalent unit cases) after considering the impact of structural changes. For the Bottling Investments operating segment, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume after considering the impact of structural changes. The Bottling Investments operating segment reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only. "Price/mix" represents the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold, and the mix of channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred. First quarter 2018 financial results were impacted by one less day, and fourth quarter 2018 financial results will be impacted by one additional day as compared to the same periods in 2017. Unit case volume results for the quarters are not impacted by the variances in days due to the average daily sales computation referenced above.
Conference Call
The company is hosting a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss first quarter 2018 operating results today, April 24, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. ET. The company invites participants to listen to a live webcast of the conference call on the company’s website, http://www.coca-colacompany.com, in the "Investors" section. An audio replay in downloadable digital format and a transcript of the call will be available on the website within 24 hours following the call. Further, the "Investors" section of the website includes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the company’s results as reported under GAAP, which may be used during the call when discussing financial results.

BURLEY, Idaho (AP) — An unexploded bomb has been found in the doorway of a new, unopened downtown Idaho restaurant.
The Times-News reports a bomb squad from Twin Falls detonated the bomb in Burley shortly after 8 a.m. Monday.
Authorities say the bomb's fuse had been lit but the device didn't detonate.
Firefighters found the bomb while extinguishing a blaze at an empty building across the street. Authorities say they're not certain whether a bomb started the fire, but they're working under that assumption.
No one was injured.
Cassia County Undersheriff George Warrell says authorities are hoping someone has more information about a white pickup spotted in the area around the time they believe the bomb was set.
The incident is under investigation.

NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — This year’s Big Dance has brought with it some serious upsets.
Ar you still holding out hope for your NCAA bracket? If so, you might be one of the lucky few.
The world of college basketball handicapping has thrown up an air ball in this year’s March Madness. Game after game and upset after upset, underdogs are taking over in historic fashion.
Just going into the Sweet Sixteen, we’ve already lost nine of the 16 highest ranked teams.
CBS2’s Marc Liverman managed to find one lucky guy who claims his bracket is still in the running.
“I got Kentucky going, beating Duke in the finals,” Staten Island resident Chris Taccetta said. “I’m looking good right now.”
For some folks, losing in their bracket isn’t the worst news possible if it means their team is heading to the Sweet Sixteen. Few people picked Syracuse to go as far as they have, but alumni won’t complain any time soon.
Allen Rodgers says now that he’s out, he’s rooting for the home team; ‘Cuse for the win.
So whether you’re in or you’re out, sit back and enjoy the madness.

"Despite having low levels of circulating testosterone, very few subjects reported symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency or excess," Page said.Researchers say longer term studies are currently underway to confirm that the pill can block sperm production so a man cannot get his partner pregnant.The study included 100 healthy men, ages 18 to 50 years old, and took place at the University of Washington Medical Center and at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Torrance, California.DMAU is being developed by the National Institutes of Health, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, which funded this study.
MOSCOW (AP) — The Tass news agency says that Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived at a Russian military air base in Syria.
Tass said that Putin's plane landed at the Hemeimeem air base in Syria's coastal province of Latakia, the heartland of Syrian President Bashar Assad's Alawite minority. The visit marks Putin's first trip to Syria and comes as Assad's forces have retaken control over most of Syria under the Russian air cover.
The air base has served as the main foothold for the air campaign Russia has waged since September 2015 in support of Assad.

Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav, facing a ‘political coup” by his son and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, has rushed to Delhi to meet the Election Commission (EC) for derailing the efforts of Akhilesh to get the cycle election symbol.
Mulayam Singh Yadav, accompanied by his younger brother Shivpal Yadav and friend Amar Singh, have reached Delhi to meet Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Nasim Zaidi at 1400 hrs. Before leaving for New Delhi, Mulayam ruled out his health woes. “You see, I am fit” The SP chief further claimed that the party’s election symbol was his signature, hence there is no question of anyone getting it by holding an illegal meeting and toppling.
“I have made this party with strong dedication and hard work, but now some people are trying to throw me out. “Media ne hamesha mera sath diya hai, maine koi bhrashtachar ya galat kaam nahi kiya. Ilzaam laga bhi toh SC ne mujhe bari kiya hai (Media has always supported me. I have never done any corruption or wrong thing.
Once an allegation was made against me, but the Supreme Court had given me a clean chit),” he said. Earlier, Mulayam had also cancelled his proposed national convention here on January 5, after his son and UP CM put all spanners not to give permission to hold any meeting at the government venue.
The meeting was slated to be held at the Janeshwar Mishra Park, where a meeting was held yesterday to declare Akhilesh as the party’s national president, removing Mulayam. Shivpal Singh Yadav, who was ousted by Akhilesh as the state party chief, today informed the media that the January 5 meet has been cancelled. However, he did not give any concrete reason for the cancellation.
The January 5 was called after Akhilesh was declared the SP’s national president, in place of Mulayam. There were also reports that the state government had refused to give permission to hold a meeting at the Janeshwar Mishra Park. It seems that the rift is still not bridged as last night, even after Mulayam complained of high blood pressure, Akhilesh who stays at the adjoining bungalow, did not rush to see his father.
Akhilesh said, “Sometimes to protect the ones you love, you must make the right decision.What I did was a tough decision, but 1 had to take it for the betterment of the party and the party supporters”.
Drinking alcohol can give you more than bad breath. A new study finds it can change the bacteria in your mouth and not for the better.Researchers say people who routinely drink one or more alcoholic beverages a day may have an overabundance of bad bacteria in their mouth, compared to nondrinkers. It can lead to lead to gum disease, heart problems and even some cancers."Our study offers clear evidence that drinking is bad for maintaining a healthy balance of microbes in the mouth and could help explain why drinking, like smoking, leads to bacterial changes already tied to cancer and chronic disease," says study senior investigator and epidemiologist Jiyoung Ahn, PhD.Possible explanations for drinking-related microbiome imbalances, Ahn says, could be that acids in alcoholic beverages make the oral environment hostile for certain bacteria to grow. Another reason, she says, could be the buildup of harmful byproducts from alcohol's breakdown, including chemicals called acetaldehydes, which along with the harmful toxins in the mouth from tobacco smoke, are produced by certain bacteria, such as Neisseria.The study was published in the journal Microbiome online April 23 and led by NYU School of Medicine researchers.
A memorial service will be held for a Marin County sheriff's deputy who died in a solo-vehicle crash in the west part of the county, sheriff's officials said.A service for 24-year-old Ryan Zirkle of Petaluma is scheduled for 11 a.m. Friday at the Marin Center at 10 Avenue of the Flags in San Rafael.Zirkle lost control of his vehicle on a left turn on state Highway 1 just north of Point Reyes Station Road shortly after midnight last Thursday, California Highway Patrol spokesman Andrew Barclay said.The vehicle went off an embankment on the right side of the road and struck a tree.Zirkle was hired as a deputy in December 2015. He was assigned to the Point Reyes substation.Marin County Sheriff Robert Doyle said someone called 911 to report signs of a traffic accident and then hung up.Doyle said Zirkle had not been heard from for several minutes so his partner was dispatched to investigate and discovered the crash.First-responders needed 35 minutes to remove Zirkle from his vehicle. He was flown to Petaluma Valley Hospital where he died.Doyle said Zirkle grew up and attended schools in Novato and attended Sacramento State University.He was described as a happy, enthusiastic, positive man who wanted to serve the community.Zirkle's fiancée was out of town at the time of the crash and her father returned her to Marin County. Zirkle recently bought her a home in Petaluma, Doyle said.
NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — Buddy was in bad shape six weeks ago.
The 1½-year-old German shepherd was left tied up outside an animal shelter in Brooklyn.
“Our worker found him sort of in a small pool of blood,” said Dr. Robin Brennen of Animal Care Centers of NYC. “Our medical team took a look at him and very quickly realized that he had actually severed off or chewed off his foot and the lower half of his ankle bone.”
Doctors believe he chewed off his foot because there may have been something tied around his leg that cut off his blood supply, leaving his foot to atrophy.
Doctors considered fully amputating his leg, which would have been the easiest and least expensive way to treat Buddy. But the team chose to save his leg and get him fitted for a prosthesis, which they’ll try in a few weeks.
Buddy’s story of struggle has really captured the hearts of New Yorkers.
“We had a very generous New Yorker step up and offer to pay for the prosthesis and all of the aftercare and rehab,” Brennen said.
That bill will be tens of thousands of dollars, but Buddy has a lot of fans, including Adam Brickner, who will foster him at home.
“He’s as friendly as can be,” Brickner said. “Great spirits. It’s like he hasn’t even missed a step.”
Buddy will be in foster care for about three to four weeks, but he’s going to need a forever home. It’s going to be a very special family he’s looking for.
“This adopter has to understand that there could be a lot of setbacks, and there’s even a possibility that he will never accept the prothesis, which might lead to an amputation later on in his life,” Brennan said.
But for now, it’s all about resting, healing and finding that forever home.
Maybe Chris Paul’s recruitment of LeBron James started before the Rockets lost to the Warriors in Game 7. (Getty Images)
According to folklore, Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green called Kevin Durant from the Oracle Arena parking lot following the excruciating Game 7 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016, making official what was a season-long recruitment effort to get KD in California golden yellow.
Now, after an equally painful Game 7 loss to the Warriors, Houston Rockets point guard Chris Paul is working a similar angle, according to New York Times scribe Marc Stein. At the end his most recent always-great newsletter, Stein revealed that Paul’s recruitment of LeBron James has already begun:
Rest assured that the Rockets’ understandably devastated Chris Paul — who made a fast exit from Toyota Center late Monday night after being forced to watch the biggest game of his life from the bench because of his hamstring injury — has already begun his recruitment of James to Houston.
And you thought it was wild when Green recruited Durant shortly after eliminating his Oklahoma City Thunder in a seven-game Western Conference finals. Paul is reportedly trying to lure James to the Rockets before his Cleveland Cavaliers even begin their Finals series against the Warriors.
How close are Chris Paul and LeBron James?
Real close. They make up half of the infamous Banana Boat crew. They and their wives have shared many an expensive wine on vacation with Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade and their significant others.
Paul has called LeBron “one of my best friends. We talk every week, all the time.” They are godparents to each other’s children. According to The Los Angeles Times, Paul spoke at LeBron’s wedding and was at the hospital for the births of his sons in 2004 and 2007. Likewise, James called Paul one of three NBA friends in his life, along with Anthony and Wade. He attended Chris Paul Jr.’s first birthday party.
Story Continues
Anthony’s desire to be traded to Houston prior to this past season was no secret, and James has made it known that he has entertained the idea of playing with Paul, Anthony and Wade at some point.
“I really hope that, before our career is over, we can all play together,” he told Bleacher Report in 2016. “At least one, maybe one or two seasons — me, Melo, D-Wade, CP — we can get a year in. I would actually take a pay cut to do that. … It would be pretty cool. I’ve definitely had thoughts about it.”
All four are eligible to become free agents this summer. Paul and Wade will be unrestricted free agents. LeBron has a $35.6 million player option he is expected to decline, and Anthony owns a $27.9 million one that would be financially prudent to pick up. Team Banana Boat is theoretically possible.
But is LeBron joining the Rockets even plausible?
Sure. We’ll let ESPN’s Zach Lowe break down one such scenario, as he did in October 2017:
Maybe we should take the Houston threat more seriously. Harden is locked up. Paul is there. Getting off Eric Gordon is easy. Snag a pick in the process, and dumping the Ryan Anderson albatross — the one that cost them the official Team Banana Boat photographer — becomes feasible. Trade and renounce everyone else, including potentially Paul for cap purposes, and they are close enough to the double-max for Paul and LeBron that the Texas income tax edge might come into play.
Anderson’s deal is Houston’s biggest obstacle here. He’s barely even been playable in the postseason, and he’s due another $41.7 million through the 2019-20 season. That contract was the sticking point to the Rockets acquiring Anthony, and it might take more than a first-rounder to dump this time around.
In addition to creating the cap space to make a run at LeBron, the Rockets could try to negotiate with Cleveland. LeBron could opt in to the final year of his contract, and Cleveland could trade him prior to free agency, as the Los Angeles Clippers did in dealing Paul to Houston last summer, or the Cavs could work a sign-and-trade after July 1, as they did in sending him to the Miami Heat in 2014. If the Cavaliers are convinced LeBron is leaving, they may see value in getting something back in return, but if that something is assuming Anderson’s contract, they might be better served letting him walk.
Then, there’s always the possibility that Cavs owner Dan Gilbert is so incensed by the possibility of Lebron leaving the franchise in shambles twice this decade that he refuses to facilitate any deal that makes it easier for him to form another super team in Houston. Unless he and/or Paul take a massive pay cut, LeBron signing with the Rockets as a free agent would gut their depth. Not only would Gordon’s $13.5 million salary have to come off the books, but they would have to renounce their rights to Clint Capela, the young center who will collect a hefty sum after his contributions this season.
Maybe that’s all worth it to field LeBron, Paul and James Harden on the same roster. Where there’s a will with Houston GM Daryl Morey, there’s often a way. Paul may already have the will, but before he convinces LeBron to help him get to his first Finals, he’ll have to watch his friend play in an eighth straight. Conversely, Cleveland better hope LeBron hasn’t answered Paul’s call yet.

PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — The new series "Girlfriends" features a rare trio of starring characters: women aged 50-plus.
The British series, debuting this week on the Acorn TV streaming service, stars Phyllis Logan, Miranda Richardson and Zoe Wanamaker.
They're longtime friends facing mid-life crises, including a husband's suspicious death and a wayward son out of jail and back home.
There are younger male and female characters in "Girlfriends," including Matthew Lewis, who played Neville Longbottom in the "Harry Potter" movie franchise.
But the show belongs to its three stars, including Logan, who was the admirable housekeeper Mrs. Hughes in "Downton Abbey."
Along the Chari and Logone rivers separating Cameroon from Chad's capital, four flat-bottomed boats, mounted with machine guns, brimming with Chadian and other special forces, round the curve as they approach the riverbank.
Forming an assault force, heavily armed soldiers leap out of the vessels and race up a slope to take up positions while backup forces have their machine guns at the ready.
It's all part of a military exercise that simulates going after a high-value target – a leader from the ISIS-affiliated Boko Haram insurgency, who's taken up residence in a huddle of huts on the far side of the riverfront, a terrorist safe haven. The assault force demonstrates crucial military steps before capturing and eliminating him.
Three weeks of U.S.-led counterterrorism exercises, known as Flintlock 2017, ended last month in Chad, which, along with surrounding countries, has been targeted in deadly violence by Boko Haram. The Flintlock exercises take place each year in a different African country.
Boko Haram's 8-year-old uprising began in northeastern Nigeria, to the west of Chad, and has spilled over its borders, killing thousands of people and driving almost 3 million from their homes across the region. The war left a humanitarian catastrophe in its wake.
The Trump administration's budget blueprint pledges to boost U.S. military spending by 10 percent — but also promises deep cuts in foreign aid. It's not yet clear what that might mean for U.S. counterterrorism efforts here or elsewhere in Africa, though the White House has boosted the U.S. military's authority to carry out strikes in Somalia against al-Shabaab militants linked to al-Qaida.
At the same time, the U.S. — the biggest donor to the United Nations — is making the case for cuts in U.N. funding and wants to see changes in U.N. peacekeeping operations, most of which take place in Africa.
"We need to show results," U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said earlier this month. "We need to find value."
Support for foreign nations' counterterrorism efforts, as opposed to big American deployments, were a key tool of the Obama administration. Last year, the U.S. gave $156 million for military support, training and border security in the region straddling Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon, known as the Lake Chad Basin. The military officer in charge of Flintlock 2017, Brig. Gen. Donald Bolduc, has called this region "Ground Zero" when it comes to fighting extremism in Africa.
Bolduc, the Special Operations commander in Africa, says for now, the U.S. military is continuing to pursue its objectives.
But the prospect of aid cuts worries many, as the region's humanitarian situation risks deteriorating. The U.N. warns there is a risk of famine in Nigeria's northeast, exacerbating a humanitarian disaster that has already seen children, especially those under the age of 5, dying of malnutrition, hunger and starvation.
The U.S. has given more than $321 million since last year to help those in the Lake Chad Basin, including more than $175 million in emergency food aid.
"Our assistance to this area is critical for promoting stability," said Matt Nims of the U.S. Agency for International Development, speaking at a House subcommittee hearing earlier this month.
'The military can't do it by itself'
U.S. special operations troops don't typically deploy in large numbers to help African security forces work together and fight Boko Haram, but local officials say they're useful in serving as the glue that helps everything stick together. For Flintlock 2017, forces from 27 countries took part at seven training sites across west and central Africa.
"Chad, Cameroon, Nigeria, Niger – unfortunately, the entire region, we are facing the same reality," said Cameroonian police commander Gilbert Nagassou, in charge of the border post at Kousseri, just across the river separating Chad and Cameroon. "That's why we must join forces and together confront terrorism."
When it comes to fighting Boko Haram's threats to the Lake Chad Basin, "The military can't do it by itself," Bolduc told NPR in Ndjamena, Chad's capital. "Regionalize all the efforts, work closely together in an effective military construct ... and then bring in the police, the civil administration, religious leaders and include anybody working to bring the stability necessary to the local villages."
A U.S. special forces commander involved in Flintlock, who asked that his name be withheld for security reasons, says the challenges shouldn't be underestimated.
"We have a regional issue of Boko Haram, [which] easily exploits the seams between international boundaries – especially when you have something like a river way that separates two nations," he says. "And they currently use islands in this pretty broad [Chari and Logone] river to hide out in. It's an easy area to have ungoverned and hard to police and patrol."
Members of U.S. military and, for the first time, law enforcement agencies are working with African security forces to enhance their techniques, said Billy Alfano, a special agent with the State Department's law enforcement arm, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security. "Interoperability" – groups and forces working well together — is the current buzzword.
"It's critical for our African partner nations to work together and more and more important for police to collaborate with the military, to conduct joint investigations and to truly counter the terrorism threat in the region, with law enforcement in those communities," Alfano said.
Law enforcement agents are often first responders after an attack, he explained, so training them in forensics and skills like fingerprinting also helps "attack the terrorist network."
Alfano said this year's more broadly focused exercises reflected an emphasis on governance and rule of law, "making a transition from a military-controlled area to training the police to more effectively take over when the military has moved on."
And there was what he called "a mass migration training," to teach rural communities how to respond to potential terrorists who may cross porous borders where large numbers of people are already traveling.
Cross-border cooperation
During Flintlock, training scenarios involved agents from across the region simulating the aftermath of a terrorist bombing, as well as chasing and apprehending hostage-taking terrorist suspects.
"Terrorism knows no boundaries or borders," warned Nagassou, the Cameroonian police commander. Deadly Boko Haram bomb blasts and suicide bombing raids have targeted all four countries battling the terrorist network, he said.
"Boko Haram has pledged allegiance to Islamic State," he said, "so geographic frontiers mean nothing to this group or other terrorist networks and their regional allies. Borders are simply a joke to them — they have connections and communications."
Terrorists, he said, easily slip across.
"If there's intelligence from Nigeria and it's relayed to Chad, then Cameroon must also be made aware," said Nagassou. "And Niger also needs to be informed, so that together we can nip Boko Haram's nefarious plans in the bud and stop them attacking our people."
Battle-hardened Chadian special forces are already familiar with this problem. For the past few years, they've been taking on Boko Haram extremists since violence spread across the border from northeastern Nigeria. They also were a critical force that helped end the occupation of northern Mali by al-Qaida-linked extremist fighters in 2013.
"Chadian military history has demonstrated our experience and know-how. It's not today that the Chadian army is learning how to capture and destroy the enemy. Chadian forces are used to pursuing Boko Haram," said Lt. Col. Brahim Mahamat Dahab, Chad's chief of staff for the Flintlock 2017 exercises.
He says the river scenario assault force exercise shows that Chad is capable of working with Americans, Italians "and the military from any given country, as well as our neighbors, reinforcing capacity. That's what we want to demonstrate. We need to share that knowledge with others who are also fighting Boko Haram," Brahim told NPR passionately.
Back on the banks of the Chari-Logone river in the Chadian capital, the assault force exercise ends and the Boko Haram leader is captured. Amid a hail of protective gunfire, the special operations forces head back down toward the boats and speed off down the river. Mission accomplished.
For this raid, a textbook success: the same way they hope a real-life operation would end. With the exercise over, the group whoops with satisfaction and relief.
The Central District Attorney filed on Tuesday an indictment against a haredi yeshiva dean who is suspected of criminal acts against minors.
According to Kikar News, the dean in question is a resident of a central haredi city. He left Israel after rumors about his behavior began to spread, and returned six weeks ago.
He was not arrested upon his return to Israel, and planned to accept position in a different yeshiva. However, he was arrested two weeks after his arrival and has since been interrogated many times. Several victims have come forward to complain, and there are other testimonies against him as well.
The suspect is now under house arrest for 32 days, after two former students filed claims against him, saying he attacked them.
Before he was released to house arrest, his arrest order was extended eight times. Though arrests are not usually extended so many times, in this case investigators feared he would try to interfere with the investigation process. In addition, police insisted he presented too great a danger to the public.
NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — A false alarm set off a stampede at Penn Station last week, and now some are worried that it could happen again – and that Penn Station is not prepared.
A chain of events led to a panic on Friday. First, a disabled NJ TRANSIT train led to widespread delays and left the train depot packed and crammed.
Then, as frustrated passengers crowded the platforms, Amtrak police used a Taser on a suspect, which some people mistook for the sound of gunshots.
“We received several dozen 9/11 calls from Penn Station and on 34th Street from Seventh Avenue to Broadway. All of those calls were determined to be unfounded,” NYPD Chief William Morris said. “Given our experience dealing with similar situations, we were able to quickly review all the 9/11 calls and determine that there were no actual shots fired.”
But terrified travelers ran in fear for their lives, leaving behind luggage, clothing and even shoes. As CBS2 Political Reporter Marcia Kramer reported, at least 16 people were injured as they fled what they thought was a terrorist attack.
“It probably will happen again,” said security expert and former FBI agent Manny Gomez.
But there is even more troubling news. Officials admitted that there needs to be a better plan for dealing with panicked crowds at Penn Station – fears that could easily be set off in the post-9/11 world.
CBS2’s Kramer asked the Steven Santoro, the executive director of NJ TRANSIT, if there was a contingency plan to deal with panicked situations like the one Friday night and also to deal with large crowds.
“So at Penn Station, Amtrak is the owner of that facility,” Santoro said. “What we intend to do based on the last three incidents is to get together with Amtrak and make sure we have the proper crowd control. We need to talk to Amtrak and make sure that there is a proper plan.”
Is there a proper plan? Mike Tolbert – a spokesman for Amtrak, which shares tracks with NJ TRANSIT and the Long Island Rail Road – said: “Friday’s crowding situation remains under review.”
Tolbert later insisted, “There is a communications plan and constant coordination with both LIRR and NJ TRANSIT.”
New Jersey state Sen. Robert Gordon (D-Fair Lawn) said the rail agencies had better hop to it.
“We need to do contingency planning, because these events are going to happen more frequently,” Gordon said.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority said there is a plan for crowd problems on the LIRR tracks at Penn.
“What we do when we know there’s an incident that could cause massive crowding, we’ll actually meter off and barricade some entrances so that we can help sort of control and meter the crowding that comes in,” said MTA spokeswoman Beth DeFalco.
Gomez said more needs to be done, including a coordinated communications system for notifying passengers.
“The problem here was there was no information, and the lack of information caused that spark which eventually caused that stampede,” Gomez said.
Kramer asked Santoro whether he was satisfied with the NJ TRANSIT response to the events of Friday night.
“No – obviously, the crowds were still there,” Santoro said. “We need to get with Amtrak and work out a better plan for our customers.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo is calling for first all responders at Penn Station to be trained in how to handle an anxious public. A representative for Gov. Chris Christie called the situation “unacceptable.”
The MTA said on Friday night, Amtrak police placed two people into custody for disobeying orders and used a Taser on one of them.
Amtrak later released a statement, saying the suspect was in custody. It also said the station was not evacuated and remained open.
The suspect remained hospitalized for psychological evaluation and was expected to be arrested after being discharged.
Meanwhile Monday, Amtrak said the NJ TRANST train that caused the massive crowding at Penn Station – and left passengers trapped on board for three hours – was stalled by mechanical problems involving the train’s pantograph, or power collector. Amtrak infrastructure was not to blame, the agency said.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and NASA will partner to send a supercomputer to space, the companies announced in a blog post on Monday.
The "Spaceborne Computer" will be sent up to the International Space Station (ISS), first by being launched on the SpaceX CRS-12 rocket, and then sent via the SpaceX Dragon Spacecraft. It will be a year-long experiment, with aims to eventually land on a mission to Mars—a trip of the same length.
Why? Advanced computing, currently done on land, could help astronauts survive in gruelling conditions by allowing for processing of information in real-time in space.
The Spaceborne Computer comes equipped with the HPE Apollo 40 class systems, the blog post stated, which includes a high-speed HPC interconnect running an open-source Linux operating system. Importantly, this system could eliminate communication latencies, which can take up to 40 minutes, and can "make any on-the-ground exploration challenging and potentially dangerous if astronauts are met with any mission critical scenarios that they're not able to solve themselves," Alain Andreoli, SVP and GM of HPE's data center infrastructure group, wrote in the blog post.
A computer this advanced has never run in space before, since most computing systems are not developed to survive in brutal conditions that include factors such as radiation, solar flares, micrometeoroids, unstable electrical power and irregular cooling. However, the software on this computer was developed to withstand these types of conditions, and its water-cooled enclosure for the hardware was created to help keep the system safe.
The project, Andreoli wrote, has implications beyond what it can do for a voyage to Mars. "The Spaceborne Computer experiment will not only show us what needs to be done to advance computing in space, it will also spark discoveries for how to improve high performance computing (HPC) on Earth and potentially have a ripple effect in other areas of technology innovation," Andreoli wrote.

The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers:
On Monday, a blog post by HPE announced a partnership with NASA that will send a "Spaceborne Computer"—a supercomputer—on a year-long experiment to the ISS. The project is intended to eventually end up on a voyage to Mars—which also takes a year—with the intention of helping astronauts perform high-level computation in space, which could eliminate the current lag-time in communication between space and Earth. The project is intended to have broader implications for the kind of advanced computing that can be done in space.

ORLANDO (CBS Local) – Disney World is opening up their theme parks, and their wallet, in a search for thousands of summer workers this year. The Florida resort is looking to fill around 3,500 positions and is reportedly offering signing bonuses of up to $3,000 in order to entice part-time employees.
Disney’s annual hiring blitz is in preparation for the summer vacation season and the company is looking to staff a wide variety of jobs including culinary chefs, lifeguards, bus drivers, and housekeepers. Disney began hosting a series of job fairs for these openings on April 23 at the ESPN Wide World of Sports complex, which focused on staffing the resort’s cooking positions.
A lifeguard job fair is scheduled for May 2 at Disney’s Typhoon Lagoon Water Park in Lake Buena Vista. According to the Orlando Sentinel, full-time and part-time lifeguards can get a $1,000 signing bonus in 2018, double the amount from last year.
Disney’s housekeeping job fair is being held on May 9 at the Walt Disney World Resort Casting Center. The company is also accepting applications for these openings Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Eastern Time through May. Housekeepers are receiving bonuses of $1,250 and an hourly wage of $10.50 according to the Sentinel.
Disney World’s neighbor, Universal Studios, is also stocking up on employees for the summer rush. The theme park and resort also announced that they’ll be hiring 3,000 new workers. The resort said in a press release it will be offering workers “competitive salaries and comprehensive benefits packages” as well as other perks like free admission to their park.
DETROIT (AP) — A police department in the Lansing, Michigan, area missed an opportunity to pursue criminal charges in 2004 against Larry Nassar after a teenager complained that the doctor had molested her during treatment for an abnormal spine, an official said Wednesday.
Meridian Township will make a public apology Thursday to Brianne Randall-Gay and announce changes in how it handles sexual misconduct investigations, township Manager Frank Walsh said.
Nassar, who was a sports doctor at Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics, convinced police that he had performed a legitimate procedure with his hands and even provided a Power Point presentation to explain. The case was dropped, effectively allowing Nassar to continue to molest girls and young women, including Olympians, for years until his arrest in 2016. A total of 265 women and girls have said Nassar sexually assaulted them.
"We missed it. We're not going to hide it. We were deceived," Walsh said.
The township released the 2004 police report on Randall-Gay's allegations against Nassar. Walsh said the township was told to withhold it from the public until Nassar was sentenced last week to 40 to 175 years in prison for sexually assaulting young women and girls in Ingham County. Another sentencing is underway this week in a similar case nearby in Eaton County.
In 2004, Randall-Gay was 17 when she and her mother visited Nassar to discuss treatment for scoliosis, a curvature of the spine. He sent her to physical therapy but saw her again, this time alone.
Randall-Gay had a back problem. But she told police that Nassar had removed her underwear, forcibly cupped her genitals with his hand and rubbed her breasts — all without gloves.
"She thought it was 'weird' and it 'freaked her out,'" the police report says.
Nassar told police he applied pressure to the "perineum," using a formal word for an area between the legs, and said it was done to manipulate a ligament, according to the report.
Nassar provided a paper version of a technical Power Point presentation about the ligament procedure, titled "The Grand Junction." There's no indication that police shared his explanation with an outside expert. The case was closed.
Walsh said questions about the investigation will be answered during a news conference Thursday with the police chief and Randall-Gay, who now lives in Washington state. Meridian Township paid for her to travel to Michigan to testify at Nassar's sentencing last week.
Back in 2004, Nassar "had the audacity to tell (police) I misunderstood the treatment because I was not comfortable with my body," Randall-Gay said.
It was not the only investigation over the years. A Michigan State University police investigation ended in 2014 with no charges filed. Another investigation by the university, required under federal anti-discrimination law, cleared Nassar of assault.

Roger Daltrey, "As Long As I Have You" (Republic Records)
It may seem paradoxical to begin a review of a Roger Daltrey album by mentioning Pete Townshend, but The Who vocalist himself credits his bandmate for encouragement in getting "As Long As I Have You" finished.
"I'd lost confidence in it, due to a long break recovering from meningitis," Daltrey says in a touching liner note on his first solo record since 1992.
Daltrey has embodied many characters on record, stage and screen — pinball wizard Tommy and real-life reformed criminal John McVicar among them — but he's not the kind of singer whose personality gets lost in the song. Instead, his credibility and authenticity as a vocalist make the tunes his own no matter who wrote them.
Townshend's also plays acoustic guitar and a few electrifying solos on seven of the 11 songs on the album, an exquisitely chosen selection of tunes by Stephen Stills, Parliament, Stevie Wonder, Nick Cave, K.T. Oslin by way of Dusty Springfield and Boz Scaggs, among others.
Daltrey tips his cap to his band and youth by covering a pair of tracks The Who played when they were starting out — the dynamic title song and a Joe Tex ballad, "The Love You Save."
Both Stills' "How Far" (from the first Manassas album) and Parliament's "Get On Out of the Rain" (aka "Come In Out of the Rain") could be The Who circa 1972, Daltrey singing with gusto and Townshend's guitar lines providing real lift. Oslin's soulful "Where Is a Man to Go" and Cave's "Into My Arms" are also great.
The end of the album brings a rarity: Daltrey originals. The tender "Certified Rose," with Stax-like horns, is dedicated to his daughter, while thoughtful closer "Always Heading Home" attains added poignancy in light of his brush with mortality.
Daltrey says he's ready for another Who album and this record and his 2014 collaboration with Wilko Johnson show he's still in great form. It would be an amazing journey, Pete.
Lonzo Ball didn’t arrive in the NBA as a world traveler. His first family vacation—to Hawaii, as depicted on Facebook’s “Ball in the Family”—came just before his rookie season with the Los Angeles Lakers.
But rather than use his road schedule to explore cities across North America, the Crown Prince of Chino Hills prefers to keep his pregame routine simple, consistent and restful.
As long as I get a nap, that’s pretty much it,” Ball told NBCLA.com’s Shahan Ahmed. “I got to get a nap before games. After shootaround, take a shower, then eat and take a nap.”
Related Lonzo Ball naps way more than you do
Per Ahmed, Zo knocks out for two to four hours before tipoff, pending the Lakers’ shootaround and film watching schedule. The bitter winter cold in most NBA cities doesn’t seem particularly conducive to change in that regard:
After pointing out that the cold is what stands out most to him about the road, Ball shares that he prefers staying indoors, rather than venturing into the winter cold to sight-see. Instead, he naps until it’s time for the bus to take him to the arena.
Ball, then, might simply hibernating on game days. Perhaps he’ll be more inclined to explore his road surroundings once the weather warms up.
“The goal of the camp is to help our young people manage possible problems they are faced with on a daily basis, both in and out of school,” Bryan said. “Our young people today face so many more problems in a technologically-savvy world than many of us faced in school. Our SRO team wants to provide students with the tools they need to learn how to maturely manage problems and build self-confidence while avoiding becoming victims.”
Instruction areas will include such topics as bullying; online predators; drug and alcohol awareness; confidence building, team-building exercises; a tour of the jail; and examination of the juvenile court system.
The classes will be held July 17-19 from 8 a.m. until noon and also from noon until 4 p.m. for 25 qualifying students in each session. Eligibility requirements include any male or female with a good disciplinary school record and good attendance record. Any male or female going into grades six through eight for the 2017-2018 school year will be considered.
The cost is free to any qualifying students. This year, students will receive lunch each day in partnership with the Lebanon Special School District’s Family Resource Center.

Arizona Diamondbacks starting pitcher Taijuan Walker winds up during the first inning of the team's baseball game against the Detroit Tigers, Wednesday, June 14, 2017, in Detroit. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio)
DETROIT (AP) -- Taijuan Walker pitched five sharp innings in his return from the disabled list, and the Arizona Diamondbacks won their fourth straight game, 2-1 over the Detroit Tigers on Wednesday night.
Walker (5-3) allowed a run and six hits in his first appearance since May 19. He had been out because of a blister on his right index finger.
The Diamondbacks scored two runs in the first inning, and that turned out to be all they needed. Walker was lifted after 82 pitches, but Randall Delgado pitched three scoreless innings of relief. Fernando Rodney struck out the side in the ninth for his 18th save in 21 chances.
Jordan Zimmermann (5-5) allowed two runs and six hits in eight innings.
Arizona is 9-1 in interleague play this season. The lone defeat was at home May 10 against Detroit.
The Diamondbacks took the lead right away against Zimmermann. Gregor Blanco led off the game with a single to left that got past Justin Upton for an error. Blanco went all the way to third on the play and scored on David Peralta's sacrifice fly. Brandon Drury added an RBI single, but Upton redeemed himself by throwing Chris Owings out at the plate.
Detroit was hitless until the third, when Ian Kinsler managed a two-out double and scored on Alex Avila's single.
Walker struck out six and walked one, and Zimmermann was impressive as well. After Chris Hermann's single to start the second, Arizona didn't have another baserunner until the seventh.
It was the third straight quality start for Zimmermann and the first time this year he had gone more than six innings. He struck out six without a walk and lowered his ERA to 5.35.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Diamondbacks: After a one-out walk to Avila in the first, Walker committed an obvious balk when he began his motion to the plate but didn't release the ball. It looked awkward, but he was able to continue and there was no sign of an injury.
UP NEXT
Diamondbacks: Arizona has Thursday off before starting a three-game series at Philadelphia. LHP Patrick Corbin (5-6) starts Friday night for the Diamondbacks against RHP Aaron Nola (3-4).
Tigers: Detroit begins a four-game series at home against Tampa Bay on Thursday night. RHP Justin Verlander (4-4) takes the mound for the Tigers against RHP Alex Cobb (5-5).

After dozens of coaching changes in the last 25 years, Saudi Arabia has a proven winner in charge for this year's World Cup.
Juan Antonio Pizzi led Chile to the 2016 Copa America title, but it won't likely be easy for the Argentine to get his new team to play the same kind of high-octane, pressing style he used in South America.
Most of the squad heading to Russia doesn't have any significant experience playing club football outside their homeland. The team is currently the lowest ranked of the 32 participants at No. 70.
Saudi sports authorities tried to change that by sending nine players, including four internationals, on a half-season loan to Spanish clubs in January. Although wingers Fahad Al Muwallad and Salam Al Dawsari, and midfielder Yahya Al Sherhi are being exposed to different training methods, they have not played a competitive game.
The Saudis made their World Cup debut in 1994, reaching the round of 16. Since then, the team has gone through more than 30 coaching changes while qualifying for the 1998, 2002 and 2006 tournaments and going out in the group stage.
Bert van Marwijk, who coached the Netherlands to the 2010 World Cup final, led Saudi Arabia through the most recent qualification campaign but failed to agree on a new contract to lead the team in Russia.
Edgardo Bauza replaced the Dutchman, but he lasted only two months. The Argentine was fired in November after underwhelming performances in five friendlies and was replaced by Pizzi.
Here's a closer look at the Saudi Arabia team:
COACH
Pizzi took over after failing to qualify for the World Cup with Chile.
The 49-year-old coach's target is making the round of 16. There have been signs so far of an attempt to introduce more of a passing style instead of the direct strategy used in the two years under Van Marwijk.
GOALKEEPERS
Four goalkeepers were called up for the recent warm-up games and Pizzi isn't fixed on a starter.
Walled Abdullah and Yasser Al Mosailem appear to be vying for the role. Abdullah is more experienced and is likely to be better able to handle physical challenges, although Mosailem performed well in a 1-1 draw with Ukraine in March.
DEFENDERS
The back four is an experienced unit but with three likely starters over 30 they are susceptible to pace from opponents.
The 34-year-old Omasa Hawsawi and 32-year-old Omar Hawsawi are set to partner in the center.
MIDFIELDERS
Much depends on Abdullah Otayf, a holding midfielder who has drawn comparisons with Luka Modric of Real Madrid.
If Saudi Arabia can start to play out from the back, the 25-year-old Otayf can make the team tick.
Taisir Al-Jassim, who has made more than 130 international appearances, adds to the solidity in the center while Al-Shehri provides creativity going forward.
FORWARDS
The team lacks a proven scorer at the top level with Mohammad Al-Sahlawi and Nasser Al-Shamrani both over 30 and not convincing against strong defenses.
The wide players are vital. Salem Al Dawsari and Fahad Al Muwallad, the most talented player available, provide much of the threat, although both have been sitting on the sidelines in Spain.
GROUP GAMES
The Saudis will be based in St. Petersburg but will play their opening match against host Russia in Moscow on June 14. That will be followed by a trip to Rostov-on-Don to play Uruguay on June 20 and to Volgograd to take on Egypt on June 25.

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina State wasn't supposed to even be in this position, entering February with several marquee wins and in the discussion for an NCAA Tournament bid. Yet first-year coach Kevin Keatts isn't talking about the possibility of his program getting back there after its two-year absence.
''We're not a mature enough team for me to look ahead,'' Keatts said in an interview with The Associated Press. ''We have to really stay in the moment with these guys. . I'm not one of those guys who'll put up the standings on the board and say, 'Here's where we are.' Because I think with this particular bunch, I think if you do that it can spook 'em.''
N.C. State (15-7, 5-4 Atlantic Coast Conference) was picked to finish 12th in the league. But the Wolfpack upset then-No. 2 Arizona in the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament in November, beat another No. 2 in Duke to start January, beat current No. 20 Clemson at home and won last weekend at then-No. 10 North Carolina .
Those four Quadrant 1 wins - the selection committee has moved to a four-tiered system to evaluate quality of victories - are strong headliners to the Wolfpack's resume.
But there's still work to do. N.C. State sits at No. 64 in Friday's RPI rankings because 11 wins came against Quadrant 3 and 4 opponents. In addition, the nonconference schedule wasn't strong (ranked 269th) and there were losses to UNC Greensboro (110th in the RPI) and Northern Iowa (140th).
Baylor graduate transfer Allerik Freeman referenced the goal of getting to the NCAAs after the UNC win without being asked, but Keatts is talking about the steps immediately in front of his team.
He wants them focused on continuing to refine their fullcourt-pressure style. He also wants them to take advantage of their conditioning work, which can help them wear down opponents and cut down on their own fatigue-driven mistakes late in games such as a missed boxout or a blown defensive assignment.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) – The government has told Taiwan Power Corporation to complete the removal of 100,000 barrels of nuclear waste from Orchid Island within the next nine years, reports said Wednesday.
The small island off the coast of Taitung County in the southeast is populated mostly by indigenous people, while the country’s environmental movement has for years demanded a solution from the government and from Taipower.
The Cabinet-level Atomic Energy Council (AEC) reportedly agreed to separate the issues of the removal from Orchid Island and the search for a new location.
The barrels from the island will first be transported either to the Third Nuclear Plant in Pingtung County or to the Longtan Institute of Nuclear Energy Research in Taoyuan City, reports said.
The preparations for the move by sea would take five years, the move itself four years, according to the timetable designed by Taipower.
As to the eventual end destination for nuclear waste from Taiwan’s three operating nuclear plants, the AEC reportedly told Taipower not to limit the possibilities to remote uninhabited islands or isolated areas, but to take all of Taiwan into consideration. The utility should change the past practice of only looking at relatively socially vulnerable areas, the AEC reportedly said.
The selection process needed to include close cooperation and consultation with the local authorities and population, the Cabinet body said.
Following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami which caused the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, Taiwan’s own environmentalist movement gained force, leading to the government shelving plans to build a fourth nuclear plant. The new government of President Tsai Ing-wen, which came to power last May, has promised to turn Taiwan into a nuclear-free country by 2025.
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Former UFC heavyweight champion Brock Lesnar has informed the mixed martial arts promotion that he is retired from competition.
The UFC confirmed the 39-year-old Lesnar's decision Wednesday.
Lesnar returned from a 4½-year MMA absence last July to beat Mark Hunt at UFC 200, but the result was overturned after Lesnar failed two doping tests. He was subsequently suspended from competition for a year by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, which administers the UFC's doping policy.
Lesnar's decision to retire means he has been removed from USADA's drug-testing pool, which monitors the fighters year-round.
If he decides to return to competition, he would have to serve the remaining five months of his suspension.
The decision doesn't affect Lesnar's professional wrestling career, where the multitalented athlete has spent most of the past five years. He is scheduled to perform for the WWE at WrestleMania in Orlando on April 2.
Lesnar fought for the UFC just eight times, but he became one of the biggest pay-per-view stars in the sport's history during his brief run. The former NCAA wrestling champion and WWE star drew millions of new fans to the young sport with his hulking presence and violent skills.
He made a guaranteed $2.5 million purse for his victory over Hunt last year, along with likely millions in undisclosed bonuses. But Lesnar failed a drug test taken before his fight and another on fight night. He tested positive for clomiphene, a banned substance under USADA rules.
Lesnar won the UFC heavyweight title in just his third fight for the promotion, beating Randy Couture in November 2008. He defended the belt twice before losing it to Cain Velasquez in October 2010, and he lost to Alistair Overeem in December 2011 in his final fight before his 2016 comeback.
He also endured serious health problems that curtailed his MMA fighting prime, including a bout of diverticulitis.
NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) — The Latest on Bill Cosby's sexual assault retrial (all times local):
8:45 a.m.
Bill Cosby has arrived for the 12th day of his sexual assault retrial, accompanied for the first time by his wife of 54 years.
The 80-year-old and his wife, Camille, didn't talk to reporters as they entered the suburban Philadelphia courthouse, where closing arguments and deliberations are expected Tuesday.
The comedian is charged with three counts of aggravated indecent assault.
The charges stem from Andrea Constand's allegations that he drugged and molested her at his suburban Philadelphia mansion in January 2004.
Cosby's lawyers devoted part of their case to travel records they say prove he couldn't have been there when she says the alleged assault happened.
They argue that any encounter there with Constand would have happened earlier, outside the statute of limitations.
The Associated Press doesn't typically identify people who say they're victims of sexual assault unless they grant permission, which Constand has done.

KINGSPORT, TN (WJHL) – On most days, Sullivan County’s Emergency Medical Service deals with life or death situations. But Monday morning the EMS crew stepped up to help out in a different way, partnering with the Salvation Army to collect toys for children in need this holiday season.
It’s called Fill the Box – a campaign started by Sullivan County EMS three years ago as a way to give back, collecting toys and money to help make Christmas brighter for the families that the EMS crew serves.
“We’re hoping to help the other families that are not as fortunate this year and make Christmas great for all the kids,” said Brittini Newton, a Sullivan County EMS paramedic.
Crews collect new, unwrapped toys and pile them up in the back of two ambulances to help fill any gaps in the Salvation Army’s Angel Tree Program.
“We’ve found that through the years some angels get adopted, but they just don’t seem to make it back to us, so we use toy drives like this to collect toys for those forgotten angels,” said Major Joseph May with the Kingsport Salvation Army.
That means more children in the area can wake up to a gift Christmas morning.
“To have the Sullivan County EMS helping us with this effort, it’s valuable, it’s extremely valuable,” Major May said. “They will ensure that children have a joyful Christmas that might otherwise not have anything.”
Almost all angels in Kingsport have been adopted, Major May says, but for the few left, he said, “The deadline to get angels back is December 19th, that’s next Tuesday, so you can still pick up an angel through Saturday and you have until Tuesday to get it back to us.”
It is an effort so close to the hearts of many of the Sullivan County EMS crew members.
“It’s very humbling just knowing we’re able to help the other families and help the kids,” Newton said.
Sullivan County EMS set up at the Walmart on Fort Henry Drive in Kingsport. They will collect toys until 8 p.m. Monday.

After three days, the jury in entertainer Bill Cosby’s sex assault trial outside Philadelphia has been unable to reach a verdict on three counts of aggravated indecent assault. Deliberations were set to resume Thursday.
The jury must reach a unanimous decision. If the jury tells the judge they are deadlocked, he will have considerable flexibility under Pennsylvania law in how to respond.
—
Q: How long can deliberations go?
A: It’s rare that juries go for more than a couple days, according to veteran jury consultant Art Patterson, a social psychologist with DecisionQuest, a New York-based trial consulting firm.
The Cosby jurors were picked 300 miles away in Pittsburgh and have been sequestered in the Philadelphia suburbs during the trial.
“Hung juries aren’t that common because jurors want to reach a verdict, and they usually get to a verdict,” Patterson said.
If deliberations drag on, that’s usually because either the panel is divided or, in complex cases, they are reviewing voluminous amounts of evidence. The Cosby jury got the case on the sixth day of the trial.
“People usually have their minds pretty well made up early in the deliberations process,” Patterson said.
Philadelphia-based jury consultant Melissa M. Gomez said: “There’s a good chance that there’s polarizations of opinion on either end, and they want to go through evidence carefully, simultaneously – those things are happening at once.”
—
Q: What happens if they tell the judge they are deadlocked?
A: In nearly all cases, a judge would tell them to keep at it, according to Pennsylvania criminal defense lawyer Ed Paskey, “as long as it’s not going to do violence to their conscience or their individual opinions.”
Paskey, a former prosecutor with nearly 100 jury trials under his belt, said he has seen a judge tell jurors three times to resume deliberations, and in that case they did produce a conviction in a sexual assault case.
“It’s a very, very rare occasion that a judge is going to let a jury off the hook on the first indication they’re hopelessly deadlocked,” Paskey said. “If you start to get into three or four full days, then there is going to be some concern after that point that perhaps a jury is not going to be able to reach a verdict.”
Pittsburgh defense attorney Bernard Tully, a former prosecutor, said judges usually encourage jurors facing an impasse to try again, respecting one another’s opinions, before they are willing to declare a mistrial.
“The language, a lot of times, that triggers this (is) if they come back and say, ‘We’re hopelessly deadlocked and there’s no reasonable amount of additional deliberations that would cause us to change our views,'” Tully said. “At that point, in all likelihood, the judge would declare a mistrial.”
—
Q: Short of a mistrial, can the judge take other action?
A: Patterson said judges have discretion to remove individual jurors under certain conditions.
“If the other jurors say to the judge, one juror will not deliberate, will not discuss facts, reasons, will not participate, judges have actually removed jurors. That’s a very extreme move, but it can be done,” he said.
Tully said the judge would need “some foundation or basis for that radical step,” more than simply hearing that someone has dug in their heels.
“Jurors are not required to give up a real belief just to reach a verdict,” Tully said.
—
Q: What happens to Cosby if there’s a hung jury?
A: The charges would stand. Prosecutors would get four months to decide whether to retry the case or abandon it. Tully said Cosby would likely get the same bail conditions – he is free on $1 million bond – as he has attended all the hearings.
—
Q: How do prosecutors decide whether to retry a case that produced a hung jury?
A: Patterson said the factors include prosecutors’ own analysis of the strength of the evidence, how high-profile the case is and the cost to go through another trial.
“There’s a phrase that’s often repeated, that the evidence rarely gets any better after the first trial for the prosecution,” Paskey said. He said prosecutors also factor in the willingness of victims to go through a trial again.
Prosecutors can ask the jurors who could not reach a verdict if they will discuss what occurred. If they give the district attorney the sense there were several people willing to acquit, that would complicate a decision to retry him, Tully said.
“I would think they’d listen very heavily to what the jurors had to say, if they’ll talk,” Tully said.

Report for Lake Alfred – Auburndale – Winter Haven areas
March bass fishing in Polk County is at the top of its game.
Right now during spawning season, Lakes Winterset and Howard in the South Winter Haven chain and Lakes Alfred, Rochelle and Haines in the North chain are giving us the best reports. Many bass in the seven to eleven pound range have been caught, as displayed in the photo of angler Terry Shelton in early February. Terry was fishing in nearby Turkey Creek Reservoir that day.
To attract larger bass when fishing our area use a Bass Assassin Boss Shiner swimbait in any assorted color, or my old favorite, a Booyah lipless crankbait in royalty color. Either of those choices will bring great results. If you’ve never tried them, now is the time to do it, you’ll be glad you did!
We are still getting good reports on spec fishing in our area. As a matter of fact, this year seems to be the best in quite a while. We should continue to see large specs until the end of April, so come out and get in on the action soon. It seems that the cooler weather we’ve been experiencing lately has brought out the shell crackers a little early. Lake Rochelle here in Lake Alfred is a great place to start fishing for crackers, you’ll want to use live red worms for bait.
Call me and I’ll point you in the right direction for fishing in our area. Better yet, come fish our area and stop in for first-hand daily information. We’re always stocked with live bait and a huge selection of plastic and hard baits.
Our 20th season of Ron’s Tackle Box weekly bass tournaments will begin the first Thursday in April (April 5th). Weekly registration is $30.00 per boat for a one or two man team, and the tournaments run from 6:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. each Thursday through the end of October. Prizes are awarded for the largest bass as well as 1st, 2nd and 3rd place categories. The location each week is not revealed until Thursday mornings and is announced in The Ledger and on our website.
Like and follow us on Facebook, or you can call Ron at (863) 956-4990. These tournaments are all around great fun, come out and join us!

Spring is upon us and the warmer weather means that it is time again to watch for ticks on your furry friends.
Dr. Corin Berg, a local veterinarian says tick season is getting longer and longer each year, and says that they began seeing their first tick cases as soon as the temperature rose above 4 degrees. He says it is important for pet owners to ensure they are checking their animals regularly for the bug.
“If you have been out in tall grass, or in the parks, or somewhere where ticks could be active make a habit of really checking over your pets closely after being in those areas.”
He adds that ticks are more attracted to certain spots on animals, but that does not mean they won’t attach themselves to anywhere on your pet.
“Typically, they like to go to areas of the body where there isn’t as much fur. So, armpits, groin, inside of the ears,” Berg said.
“Although, having said that we’ve certainly seen a lot of ticks that were in the thickest part of the fur over the back, so really no area of the pet is off limits.”
Berg added that if your pet does get a tic it is important to remove it properly, so that they do not cause future problems for you, or your pet.
BOSTON (AP) — Adam Henrique scored twice and the Anaheim Ducks ended Boston's 18-game point streak with a 3-1 victory over the Bruins on Tuesday night.
Jakob Silfverberg also scored for the Ducks, the first team to beat the Bruins in regulation since Washington's 5-3 win Dec. 14 at Boston. Cam Fowler and Rickard Rakell had two assists apiece.
John Gibson made 25 saves before leaving in the third period with an undisclosed injury. Ryan Miller played the final 7:25 and nearly completed a shutout for the Ducks before Ryan Spooner scored for Boston with 41 seconds left.
Henrique scored into an empty net with 6.1 seconds remaining to seal it for the Ducks, who halted Boston's five-game winning streak and a stretch of 18 games with at least one point (14-0-4), which tied for the second-longest in franchise history.
Anton Khudobin stopped 24 shots for the Bruins, who never recovered after being outshot 15-5 in the first period and falling behind 2-0 on goals by Silfverberg and Henrique.
The Ducks have won eight straight against the Bruins, who haven't beaten Anaheim since a 3-2 shootout win on Oct. 21, 2013.
Anaheim took a 1-0 lead when Khudobin couldn't quite hang onto a long backhand by Fowler. The puck fell from Khudobin's glove and slid across the crease, where it appeared to be knocked in by Bruins captain Zdeno Chara as he went crashing into his own net 9:04 into the game. Silfverberg was credited with the goal and assists went to Fowler and Rakell, who set up the Ducks' second goal a few minutes later when Henrique scored.
The Ducks were on a power play and worked the puck around the corners, then to Henrique in the right circle for a wrist shot that beat Khudobin on the stick side at 13:59.
Gibson needed a few minutes to regroup after a hard shot from Patrice Bergeron hit him in the ribs early in the third, then ended up leaving with 7:25 left and was replaced by Miller.
NOTES: The Ducks opened a five-game road trip against Atlantic Division teams. ... Boston LW Anders Bjork left after the first period with an upper-body injury. ... Boston was without leading scorer Brad Marchand, who sat out the second of a five-game suspension for throwing an elbow last week against New Jersey.

NEW YORK (AP) — Quite a rally for Rumor — a commanding comeback for German shepherds, too.
Rumor was crowned America's top dog Tuesday night when, a year after a near miss on the very same green carpet, she came out of retirement to win best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club.
Cheered loudly all around the ring by a packed crowd at Madison Square Garden, she's just the second German shepherd champion at the event that began in 1877.
"Unbelievable," handler and co-owner Kent Boyles said.
In a year that's seen lots of late, startling twists in sports — think Patriots, Cubs and Cavaliers — Rumor pulled something of a shocker. She'd been at home in Wisconsin for months, a house pet headed toward having puppies, when she suddenly jumped back into the show ring in January.
Boyles is a fan of the Packers and star quarterback Aaron Rodgers. Seeing a pet go from the couch to this top prize, heck, that's a dog world Hail Mary.
The 5-year-old Rumor beat out a Norwegian elkhound, a Pekingese, a miniature poodle, an Irish setter, a boxer and a Norwich terrier in the final ring. The Irish setter called Adrian finished second.
"The German shepherd standard talks about quality and nobility," judge Thomas Bradley III said. "When you recognize it, it hits you at home, and that's what it really is. She is just magnificent."
Rumor is named for the hit song "Rumor Has It" by Adele, a champion herself after sweeping the major categories at the Grammy Awards on Sunday.
This was the 104th career win for Rumor, and earlier in the day, Boyles said that this would definitely, for real, be her last major show.
"She's going to be relaxing for a while," Boyles said after the win, but ultimately, there are "puppies in her future."
Clearly the crowd favorite, Rumor came out flying into the best-of-seven final ring to fans whistling and calling her name.
Rumor raised up for a well-deserved treat right after the win. Moments later, as Boyles did post-show interviews, Rumor spotted him and ran toward the man who guided her to victory.
Rumor joined the fittingly named Manhattan in 1987 as the only German shepherds to go best in show at the Garden.
There were nearly 2,800 dogs entered in the 141st Westminster canine competition, spread across the 202 eligible breeds and varieties.
The moment any German shepherd steps into the ring at the Garden, the crowd goes crazy.
New Yorkers just love 'em.
Some say it's because rooting for a German shepherd is the same as putting on an NYPD or FDNY hat, standing up for a dog that stood tall at a time of the city's greatest need.
"My sentiments, exactly," Boyles said.
While German shepherds hadn't won a lot here, many of them were on the green carpet of the center ring in 2002 when Westminster honored search and rescue dogs for their tireless work at the World Trade Center and Pentagon following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The solemn tribute is considered by many the most cherished memory ever at Westminster.
"They're loyal, dependable dogs that you can count on," Boyles said.
Rumor nearly won Westminster last year. She came to town as the nation's No. 1 show dog with more than 100 overall ribbons but was beaten in a surprise by a German shorthaired pointer named CJ.
In fact, when the judge began to announce his champion pick with "German sh...," Boyles took a step forward, anticipating the prize.
"I was thinking," Boyles said.
That was supposed to be Rumor's last show, and she was set to head home with Boyles to Edgerton, Wisconsin, to be a house pet and have puppies. She didn't conceive and late in the year, Boyles thought twice about Rumor's retirement.
"She liked to show and was in good shape, so we thought, why not?" he said.
Rumor went back on the circuit in January for 10 shows. She won the herding group Monday night at the Garden, beating top show favorite Preston the puli.
She topped that with the ultimate win at America's most prestigious dog show, rewarding the faith German shepherd fans always show in them.
"It's a recognizable dog, people have liked them for a long, long time," WKC President Sean McCarthy said earlier. "I think it goes back to Rin Tin Tin."

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on European soccer transfers on deadline day (all times local):
___
11:35 a.m.
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has joined Arsenal from Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund.
Dortmund says the teams have agreed on a transfer fee of 63.75 million euros ($80 million) — a record for the Premier League club.
Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc says Aubameyang "has done great things for Dortmund ... scored many important goals and is a part of the team that brought the German Cup to Dortmund in 2017."
Aubameyang had been dropped as a disciplinary measure for missing a team meeting, the third time the Gabon striker had been sanctioned by Dortmund in a little over a year.
Aubameyang scored 141 goals in 213 appearances for Dortmund since joining from French club Saint-Etienne in 2013.
Arsenal says the deal is subject to the completion of "regulatory processes."
___
11:15 a.m.
Will Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang leave Borussia Dortmund for Arsenal? Will Riyad Mahrez move to Manchester City?
It's the final day of Europe's transfer window and there are potentially some big deals to be finalized, especially in the Premier League, where clubs have already spent a record amount in January.
The most significant transfer could see Aubameyang join Arsenal for a reported 64.5 million euros ($80 million) in a move that would have a domino effect, with Dortmund needing a replacement and Arsenal looking to offload striker Oliver Giroud.
Man City broke its transfer record to sign Aymeric Laporte for $80 million on Tuesday and could surpass that a day later if the Premier League leaders succeed in bringing in Mahrez from Leicester.
No major signings are expected in Spain or France.

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on the London high-rise fire (all times local):
8:10 a.m.
Community centers in London have been overwhelmed by the number of donations flooding in for those left homeless by a high-rise apartment building fire.
So much food, clothing, shoes and other items have been coming in that the centers, churches and mosques have had to start turning away new donations. At least 12 people have been killed in the inferno at the 24-story building, with the death toll expected to rise. Dozens of others have been hospitalized.
Missing people posters have been put up throughout the north London neighborhood of North Kensington. Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has offered free food for survivors at one of his nearby eateries.
___
7:40 a.m.
London fire investigators are painstakingly searching for more victims of an inferno that engulfed a high-rise apartment building and killed at least 12 residents.
Authorities say the death toll is expected to rise as emergency workers sift through more of the wreckage on Thursday.
The fire early Wednesday in the 24-story building in west London's North Kensington district also injured dozens, 18 of them critically, and left an unknown number missing. The cause of the blaze is under investigation, but a tenants' group had complained for years about the risk of a fire.
More than 1 million pounds ($1.27 million) has been raised to help victims of the tragedy as volunteers and charities worked through the night to find shelter and food for people who lost their homes.
Whether it's the infamous "Veterans For Standing Rock" with their missing $1.1 million, or another organization in the litany of Standing Rock-based pages on the website, rough estimates for the amount raised on these pages have been reported to be around $11 million. Just as a point of reference, the state of North Dakota already has spent more than $30 million managing the crisis these donations were meant to fund.
All of this begs the question of whether GoFundMe shoulders any of the blame for providing a platform to fundraise for illegal protest activities—activities that include repeated violent attacks against our North Dakota law enforcement officers, using everything from Molotov cocktails and other improvised explosive devices to actual guns.
Do the site's owners care that they are actively enabling professional protesters to come into our community and disrupt the lives and livelihoods of both the residents of Morton County and members of the Standing Rock tribe alike?
When you take a deeper look at GoFundMe, it becomes clear that the answer is no.
GoFundMe is a business. And their business is fundraising for "causes" like these protesters. In 2015, Forbes magazine published an article outlining how GoFundMe earns "profits off of controversy." As the company outlines in its "Common Questions" page, GoFundMe takes a 5 percent fee from every contribution made over the site, along with an additional 3 percent processing fee.
Meaning the company has made roughly $880,000 off of these DAPL protests without having to do a thing beyond maintaining the website.
Pretty good haul for just shy of six months.
While the website has no official ideological loyalty, all you have to do is look at members of the company's senior leadership to get an idea of where they fall on the political spectrum.
The company's chairman and CEO, Rob Solomon, gave the maximum amount in contributions allowed by law to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. President and Chief Product Officer David Hahn is a former staffer for ultra-liberal California Senator Diane Feinstein.
And GoFundMe's vice president for communications and policy is none other than Dan Pfeiffer, former senior advisor, White House communications director and long-time confidant of President Obama.
Shockingly, there are no former Republican political staff members serving as executives for GoFundMe.
So the truth is, despite the violent and illegal behavior these GoFundMe pages are supporting, the company probably doesn't care. They are probably indifferent to the close to 600 people who have been arrested during these protests, or the public posting of threats against police officers, community leaders and their families.
They're making a hefty profit while supporting the liberal causes they personally believe in, while never having to leave sunny California.
It's all win-win for them, even if it's all lose-lose for North Dakota and its residents.
Hennen is the host of What's On Your Mind radio show, heard throughout North Dakota on AM 1100 TheFlag and AM 550 KFYR.
RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) -- An analysis by The Associated Press shows that the cost of putting on last year's Rio de Janeiro Olympic was $13.1 billion.
At a news conference Wednesday, officials of Brazil's Public Authority for Olympic Legacy said the cost for only ''sports-related venues'' was 7.23 billion reals ($2.06 billion). In addition, the Rio organizing committee previously listed the costs of running the Games at 9 billion reals ($2.8 billion).
The Olympic legacy body did not account for other Olympic-related costs. But the AP obtained them in emailed statements from city, state and federal agencies.
Those costs were 26.385 billion reals ($8.2 billion) for, among other things, a subway line, a doping laboratory, a renovated port and cleanup of polluted Guanabara Bay.
Federal prosecutor Leandro Mitidieri said he had to ask himself if a ''country with such inequality as Brazil should have hosted such an event.''
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Diane Keaton is such a special entertainer that even normally reclusive Woody Allen is appearing in a televised tribute to her.
Allen is among those honoring the actress in the American Film Institute's presentation of its 45th Life Achievement Award. The AFI's "Tribute to Diane Keaton" will premiere Thursday night on TNT.
Warren Beatty, Morgan Freeman, Reese Witherspoon, Jane Fonda and Emma Stone also paid homage to Keaton during a gala ceremony last week in Hollywood. Steve Martin and Martin Short performed a musical roast of the actress.
Allen, who directed Keaton to her Oscar-winning performance in "Annie Hall," said he owes much of what he's accomplished in his life to her.
A boy about six months old was brought to the Magen David Adom emergency service at the Sarah Junction Route 40 entrance to Be'er Sheva', Monday evening after he drowned in a tub.
The infant was described in serious condition as medics and paramedics engaged in resuscitation efforts.
MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Manchester City scored its 100th goal of the season on the way to a 3-0 win over West Bromwich Albion on Wednesday to extend its lead in the Premier League to 15 points.
Fernandinho, Kevin De Bruyne and Sergio Aguero scored as City won a 12th consecutive home league game.
West Brom is three points adrift at the bottom of the division.
While the scorer of City's opening goal was a surprise, the source of the assist was predictable. De Bruyne played a defense-splitting pass through to Fernandinho who squeezed his shot past Ben Foster at the near post to give the home side the lead after 20 minutes.
City suffered a blow shortly before the break as David Silva was forced off injured, just days after Leroy Sane was ruled out for six weeks.
West Brom fought on despite rarely threatening but had its challenge effectively ended in the 68th when De Bruyne appropriately scored City's 100th goal of the season in all competitions.
The Belgium midfielder, who has been at the center of City's near perfect season to this point, played Raheem Sterling behind the visitors' defense before receiving the ball back and finishing neatly from close range.
Daniel Sturridge came off the bench to make his West Brom debut after joining on loan from Liverpool until the end of the season, but wasted his side's best chance of the game, before Aguero showed him how it's done.
Sterling was the creator once more as he slid Aguero in behind the defense, before the Argentina striker dinked the ball over the oncoming Foster with just a minute remaining.
LONDON (AP) — Tim Cahill signed a short-term deal with English second-tier club Millwall on Monday in a move designed to help Australia's all-time record scorer prepare for the World Cup in Russia.
The 38-year-old forward returns to a team for whom he scored 57 goals in 251 appearances from 1998-2004. He will stay at Millwall until the end of the English season, which finishes about a month before the World Cup.
"The romance of the story is definitely not lost on me," Cahill said. "I've always said that if I came back to England, I'd come home. Millwall is where I learnt my trade and it was the most important learning period of my life."
Cahill left Millwall for Everton in 2004, then joined New York Red Bulls in 2012. He went on to have a spell in China before returning to Australia to join Melbourne City in 2016.
With the help of Cahill, Australia qualified for the World Cup by beating Honduras in an intercontinental playoff over two legs in November.
An Edmonton man was charged with impaired driving and firearms offenses after a hit-and-run in Jasper National Park on Sunday.
James Nicholas Percy, 35, was arrested on Highway 16 near disaster point after fleeing the scene of a collision near Pocahontas Cabins shortly before 3 p.m.
According to Jasper RCMP it all started with complaints of an erratic driver from the public and from Hinton RCMP heading westbound toward the park. Jasper RCMP members responded and headed east but almost immediately after received a report of a two-vehicle collision.
It got worse.
“A male suspect had exited his vehicle and was yelling at bystanders and attempting to fight them,” Const. Patrick Vallee said in a press release. “The suspect then got back into his vehicle and fled the accident scene.”
He pulled over a short distance west of the scene at a spot known as disaster point and according to bystanders, started loading what looked like a gun, hiding behind his vehicle. Many of the members of the public likewise took cover behind their own vehicles.
Two Jasper RCMP officers conducted a “high-risk arrest” and took the suspect into custody without incident. He was transported to hospital to be treated for non-life threatening injuries he sustained in the collision.
“The RCMP would like to thank the public for its assistance during and after this incident,” Vallee said.
Percy was found to be in possession of more than one firearm, triggering a host of Criminal Code, traffic, drug and National Parks Act charges including impaired operation, dangerous operation, failing to remain, possession of a controlled substance and unsafe storage of a firearm.
The complete list of charges is below. None of the charges have been proven in court; Percy is scheduled to appear in Jasper court on Dec. 14.
– 2 counts of unsafe storage of a firearm 86(2) Criminal Code
– Possession of a prohibited device 91(2) Criminal Code
– Possession of a prohibited device in a motor vehicle 94 Criminal Code
– Dangerous operation of a motor vehicle 249(1)(a) Criminal Code
– Failing to remain at an accident scene 252 Criminal Code
– Impaired operation of a motor vehicle 253(1)(a) Criminal Code
– Possession of a controlled substance 4(1) Controlled Drugs and Substances Act
– 3 counts of possession of a firearm in a National Park 24(2) Canada National Parks Act
– 2 counts of possession of a firearm in a motor vehicle 24(2) Canada National Parks Act
A year later, Smith is enjoying track and winning shot put and discus events, all the while hoping to reach the next rung of the ladder before she enters high school.
Qualifying for the Class A state meet in a throwing event would be quite an achievement for an eighth-grader, but it’s one that Smith, her head coach Cathy Henkels, and her parents Jerome and Marcia Smith, say is par for the course.
“She’s a hard worker,” Henkels said. “She has a lot of lofty goals, I think. And she’s got a great coach (Erin Elder). He will get everything out of her that she’s capable of doing. She’s just a powerful girl. She will listen. When you tell her to do something for you, she goes out and does it.”
On Monday at an eight-team meet in Windom involving the host Eagles, Worthington, Heron Lake-Okabena, BOLD, Cedar Mountain/Comfrey, New Ulm, Redwood Valley and Wabasso, Smith’s first event was the discus, and she performed very well, surpassing 111 feet.
Redwood Valley’s Emma Gaffney, a senior, won the event with a throw of 117-10. Smith’s toss placed her second, even though the mark exceeded the 103-4 and 106-4 throws she’d used to win other competitions already this season.
“I’ve been working for 110 for a while,” Smith said Monday. “I’ll start working for 120, and if I get my technique down I’ll be pretty close.”
Always striving to improve, Smith said she still isn’t wide enough in the circle, and she’s not low enough, either.
Her goal is to get to state in both the discus and shot put. In the latter event, she’s hoping that by working on a “glide” approach rather than the “three-step,” she’ll add more distance. Monday -- an absolutely perfect day for a track meet -- was the first time she’d planned to go the glide in an actual meet.
“I was in softball until last year, and my coach wanted me to try out for track,” said Smith, who admitted that before last year, “I didn’t really know shot and discus are things.”
“Erin Elder convinced her to try track,” said her mother, Marcia. “If you’re going to try something different, you might as well do it now. Her softball coach wasn’t so happy, though. They tried to convince her she could do both.”
That’s out. For now, anyway.
On Monday, Smith improved on her second-place finish in the discus, winning the shot put event with a throw of 37-0 while Gaffney finished second at 36-04.
Thuringer having a busy spring
In another section of the Windom track on Monday, Worthington junior Emma Thuringer stood in line for her turn in the girls long jump. It was a long line, almost like you’d expect the line to be outside a movie theater for a Star Wars premiere.
But Monday’s meet was an all-comers affair, where all teams were encouraged to enter every varsity performer they wanted to get a look at.
“Today I don’t mind (the line), ‘cuz it gives me time to catch my breath,” Thuringer said.
She was having a busy meet in a season of busy meets for her. She was entered in the 4 x 200-meter relay, the open 400 meters, the 4 by 400-meter relay and the long jump. A little bit before her wait in the long jump began, she placed second in the 400 (1:03.84). Prior to that, the 4 x 200 didn’t go quite as well because the team’s first and second runners fumbled the baton on an exchange and the foursome finished fifth. The Trojans’ 4 by 400 team (Thuringer, Adamari Rangel, Madisyn Huisman and Sena Uli) placed second behind Redwood Valley at 4:34.51.
Thuringer is having a good start to the 2017 campaign. She’s already achieved firsts this spring in the 400, the 200 and the long jump.
“I’ve won the 200 twice, so that’s good. It’s been competitive. It’s nice to have some good competition. I’d like to get my 400 down a couple of seconds (her best times in the 400 were achieved when she was a freshman).”
Thuringer placed seventh in the long jump Monday (13-04.25).
Another Trojan, Obang Ojulu, won the boys 110-meter high hurdles Monday with a clocking of 16.49. He also took part in the winning boys 4 x 200 relay team (Eh Kyoo, Alex Baustian, Ojulu, Frank Rogers), which covered the distance in 1:36.14.
“I had a slow start,” Ojulu said about his hurdle race, “but once I got past the first two hurdles, it was all right. I was able to win. That was my first time running the four by two. We had a really good lead, so it was a lot of fun.”
Ojulu, like Thuringer, is a busy spring athlete. He also competes in the 300-meter hurdles, and on Monday he won that race in 42.42. He has goals this year of breaking the school record in the 300 held by GBrown Ochothow, and qualifying for state.
Two other WHS boys relay teams took firsts in Windom. The 4 x 100-meter team of Kyoo, Baustian, Cesar Barralaga and Rogers won in 46.62. The 4 by 400-meter team of Emmett Bicket, Stewart Merrigan, Chris Nelson and Nathan Schuck won in 3:42.72.
Nelson also won the 800-meter race in 2:13.00.
NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — A counter-terrorism security expert said the capture of a suspect in today’s underground explosion at the Port Authority Bus Terminal could provide investigators with new information about potential conspiracies against the safety of New Yorkers and if a specific organization was behind today’s incident.
Monday’s pipe bomb blast left four people injured, including the suspect said to have been wearing a secondary explosive device.
“This is something that is a game changer,” said security expert Manny Gomez. “If we’re going to have suicide bombers here like we’ve had overseas, that is going to be a problem because obviously… that’s never happened in the continental U.S. If they are successful in recruiting suicide bombers, we’re going to have a problem.”
“Now (police) have what was one of their worst fears: A bomber who is clearly prepared to take his own life to take as many other people as possible,” he said.
The suspect has been identified as Akayed Ullah, 27, who was wearing an improvised explosive device, Police Commissioner James O’Neill said. Ullah is from Bangladesh and was living in Brooklyn.
Gomez said investigators will now be interviewing Ullah’s friends and family as well as looking at international contacts.
“This is happening as we speak, fortunately we got this person alive, we will very quickly be able to identify who he is… to ascertain if this person had other people working with him and if there is a possibility of a conspiracy,” he said.
The fact one of the explosive devices was taken intact before being detonated will provide investigators with a wealth of information, Gomez said.
“The investigation is obviously tell by the forensics of the explosive device how sophisticated it is, how the wiring and types of materials are used in the pipe bomb,” he said. “That in and of itself will determine if this person helped in the creation of this bomb, the signature of the bomb itself will tell us what organization – perhaps even what terrorist bomb maker was the person who invented this bomb… That will tell us if this bomb was given to him by an outside source, or was he able to make this bomb himself.”
“A lot of these bombing attempts are thwarted on their own due to premature explosions, things of that nature – but these things do go on internationally,” Gomez said. “If this shows there are more that are coming, that’s going to be a problem for the city.
Hopefully this not what is preliminarily appears to be.”
Gomez is a former special agent with the FBI who investigated terrorism and espionage cases as an agent in the National Security Division. He is also a former sergeant in the NYPD.
PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — School officials in Rhode Island say a teenager has been arrested for shooting the window of an elementary school bus with a pellet gun.
WPRO-AM reports that the shooting happened Monday afternoon in North Kingstown.
Superintendent Philip Auger says no one was injured, but some children were hit with safety glass from the broken window.
Auger emailed parents Monday night to say the person responsible was arrested.
He says the bus was bringing students home from Fishing Cove Elementary School.
After the shooting, the bus driver pulled away, checked on the students and called police. Students were taken home on another bus.
Auger says the school department is cooperating with police.

A couple who fell seriously ill near the English town of Amesbury were poisoned with the same Novichok nerve agent used in the Skripal incident, British police confirmed on Wednesday.
The Skripal case caused a rift between the UK and Russia, after the UK concluded that the nerve agent used was Soviet-made. Moscow denied the claim and the confrontation led to an exchange of diplomat expulsions between both countries.
What we know so far:
The victims are a 45-year-old man and a 44-year-old woman, who were discovered unconscious on Saturday at a house in a quiet neighborhood of Amesbury.
The couple are in a critical condition in the same UK hospital where Sergei Skripal and his daughter Julia were treated earlier this year.
Amesbury is 12 kilometers (8 miles) from Salisbury, where the Skripals were poisoned.
Local police have established two help lines to take calls from those who may have concerns about a possible contamination.
Counter-terrorism police are now handling the case.
No danger to public
Neil Basu, Britain's most senior counter-terrorism officer, told reporters it was unclear how they came into contact with the nerve agent or whether they had been specifically targetted.
A Downing Street spokesperson said the incident was being treated "with the utmost seriousness."
England's Chief Medical Officer said the risk to the general public remained low.

TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares skidded Tuesday following Wall Street's biggest loss in more than four months. Japan's benchmark languished as the yen firmed against the U.S. dollar.
KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 index lost 1.4 percent to 23,291.97 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 1.1 percent to 32,601.62. South Korea's Kospi sank 1.1 percent to 2,567.74. The Shanghai Composite index fell 0.8 percent to 3,495.05 and Australia's S&P ASX 200 gave up 0.9 percent to 6,022.80. India's Sensex lost 0.6 percent to 36,067.22. Shares also were lower in Taiwan, Singapore and Indonesia.
WALL STREET: The sell-off was led by technology stocks, the biggest gainers in 2017, which accounted for much of the slide. Energy companies also fell as crude oil prices finished lower. Utilities and other rate-sensitive sectors declined as bond yields hit their highest level in almost four years. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 0.7 percent to 2,853.53 and the Dow Jones industrial average also dropped 0.7 percent, to 26,439.48. The Nasdaq composite lost 0.5 percent, to 7,466.51. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks gave up 0.6 percent to 1,598.11. Losers outnumbered gainers almost five-to-one on the New York Stock Exchange.
TRUMP: Also on investors' radar: Tuesday night's State of the Union address by President Donald Trump, and a two-day meeting of the Federal Reserve's policymaking committee that wraps up Wednesday. "This is one of the few prepared speeches that the president will give, so the progress on NAFTA and trade with China is something the market is going to watch carefully," said Mike Baele, senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bank Private Wealth Management.
JAPAN: Data for December released Tuesday showed the jobless rate rising to a still low 2.8 percent and retail sales coming in stronger than expected. But household spending and willingness to spend fell, underscoring the need for wage increases during the annual spring labor negotiations that are underway.
ANALYST'S VIEWPOINT: "Asian markets are set to see further pullback in the day, caught in the crosswind of the overnight action. In particular, the performance of Apple Inc.'s regional supply chain is expected to come into focus as reports of a production reduction to the company's leading iPhone X floated to the market," Jingyi Pan of IG said in a commentary.
ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 71 cents to $64.85 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It lost 58 cents, or about 1 percent, to settle at $65.56 a barrel on Monday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, dropped 52 cents to $68.68 a barrel. It fell $1.06, or 1.5 percent, to close at $69.46 per barrel on Monday.
CURRENCIES: The dollar, which fell sharply last week, declined to 108.69 yen from 108.96 yen late Monday. The euro fell to $1.2360 from $1.2383.
BITCOIN: The price of bitcoin fell 1.5 percent Monday to $10,987.84 , according to the tracking site CoinDesk. Bitcoin futures on the Cboe Futures Exchange fell 2.5 percent to $10,920.
COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — An Ohio officer's fatal shooting of a 16-year-old boy during a scuffle outside a juvenile courtroom has some people questioning whether such sheriff's deputies should carry guns while monitoring that court.
The Columbus Dispatch reports the Jan. 17 shooting of Joseph Haynes prompted an online petition demanding that deputies stop carrying guns in Franklin County Juvenile Court.
An official from the local police union that represents deputies says taking away guns from trained officers would be a mistake.
Sheriff Dallas Baldwin declined to talk about whether court security measures are being reviewed, saying such discussion would be inappropriate until the shooting investigation is finished.
Court security by armed deputies is common practice, though not universal. Connecticut and Massachusetts don't allow their court-employed security officers to carry guns in court.

GENEVA (AP) — A group of U.N. human rights experts are expressing concerns about the health of the widow of late Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, saying the Chinese government should let her seek treatment wherever she wishes.
The independent experts commissioned by the U.N.'s Human Rights Council reiterated their call to Chinese authorities to indicate where Liu Xia is being held, and to release her.
The U.N. rights office says she has been under house arrest since 2010, when her husband won the Nobel prize. He died in custody last year.
The experts say Liu Xia reportedly suffers from "severe psychological distress," pointing to audio recordings released in May in which she pleads for help.
She was last seen in public at his funeral, accompanied by authorities.

In an interview with Playboy, the newly-single Scarlett Johansson shared some thoughts about monogamy, relationships and whether or not it’s “natural” to want to be with the same person forever and ever.

In the interview, she makes a lot of pretty good points against the institution of marriage. Even more interesting is the timing. Us Weekly speculates that the interview was likely conducted before her split from Romain Dauriac. Even if that happens to be the case, none of the stuff she’s saying is particularly invalid.
“Well, with every gain there’s a loss, right? So that’s a loss. You have to choose a path. I think the idea of marriage is very romantic; it’s a beautiful idea, and the practice of it can be a very beautiful thing. I don’t think it’s natural to be a monogamous person. I might be skewered for that, but I think it’s work. It’s a lot of work.”
It’s entirely possible to have these feelings about monogamy and stay married, but after reading the rest of what she had to say, I feel like ScarJo is probably much happier unattached — or at the very least, not married.

“Being married is different than not being married, and anybody who tells you that it’s the same is lying. It changes things. I have friends who were together for 10 years and then decided to get married, and I’ll ask them on their wedding day or right after if it’s different, and it always is. It is.”
“The fact that it is such work for so many people—for everyone — the fact of that proves that it is not a natural thing,” she said of marriage. For whatever it’s worth, she and her ex are putting up a nice front.

According to People, the thieves absconded with “a safe containing approximately $2 million worth of jewelry and other items or property.” Morrissette wasn’t home at the time, so at least there’s that. There’s also this: TMZ spoke to some “law enforcement sources” who reportedly said that celebrity Instagram accounts are essentially handbooks for criminals —the very same argument made by authorities regarding Kim Kardashian’s robbery, too.
A brief dive into Alanis’s Insta revealed this, which was perhaps the catalyst for the robbery?
Further perusal of her ‘gram reveals a deep love of kilim rugs, juices and a variety of oils. Very soothing, highly recommended.

NAPLES, Italy (AP) — Napoli full back Faouzi Ghoulam has had a third operation on his right knee but the Algeria international should be fit to take part in pre-season training.
Ghoulam missed most of last season after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his knee in November and fracturing his kneecap in training in February.
There were fears he had another problem after his knee swelled up on holiday recently and Ghoulam underwent further tests earlier this week.
On Wednesday Napoli says Ghoulam had "a small operation to remove the metal pin in his right patella."
It adds: "Ghoulam will follow a personalized training schedule next week."
STILLWATER, Okla. (AP) -- Broc Everett made his first college golf title one to remember.
Given a second chance, on the 18th hole, Everett poured in a 15-foot birdie putt in a playoff to beat Brandon Mancheno of Auburn and win the NCAA men's individual title Monday at Karsten Creek Golf Club.
''I was fortunate to get another chance - and a good look,'' said Everett, a senior at Augusta.
Everett had a 10-foot birdie putt to win in regulation and missed it to the right. He closed with a 1-under 71 and joined Mancheno at 7-under 281. Mancheno, a freshman for the Tigers, got up-and-down from the right side of the green on the par-5 18th tor a 72.
In the playoff on No. 18, Mancheno went for the green with a long iron. He pulled it to the right, and the ball bounced next to a tree, leaving an impossible shot for the left-hander. Mancheno did well to chip it across the green into the rough, and he chipped that one to a few feet to save par.
Everett laid up from the rough and hit wedge to 10 feet behind the hole. He raised both arms when the putt fell into the center of the cup, and the celebration was on.
Augusta, which won the NCAA championship at Karsten Creek in 2011 with Masters champion Patrick Reed on the team, did not make the 54-hole cut for team competition. Everett advanced as an individual.
Mancheno made only one birdie over his last 12 holes, but that was on the 18th and it gave him a chance.
''It was a great learning experience for me. This was my first try, too, so I can't be too upset with myself,'' Mancheno said. ''I put myself in a good position and I didn't play good enough today.''
Doug Ghim, the U.S. Amateur runner-up last year at Riviera, closed with a 72 with a birdie on his final hole to finish in third, one shot out of the playoff.
Oklahoma State led eight teams into the match play portion of the championship that starts Tuesday and decides the team title. The Cowboys had the low team score by eight shots on their home course.

The other teams to advance were Duke, Texas Tech, defending champion Oklahoma, Auburn, Alabama, Texas and Texas A&M. The final eight features four Big 12 teams, three from the Southeastern Conference and one from the ACC.
Noted aviator and actor Harrison Ford flew his private plane over a jet airliner on the ground at a Southern California airport Monday. It's not the first time the Star Wars and Indiana Jones star has had problems landing.
The 74-year-old Ford was instructed to land on a runway at Orange County's John Wayne Airport but mistakenly landed on a parallel taxiway, passing over a Boeing 737 carrying 110 passengers and six crew members.
On a recording, Ford asked air traffic controllers, "Was that airliner meant to be underneath me?" according to NBC News, which first reported the incident.
Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor said the pilot heard and read back the correct landing instructions, according to The Associated Press. Gregor did not confirm it was Ford who was piloting the plane, a single-engine Aviat Husky. The AP reports that he didn't say how close Ford's plane came to hitting the jet on the ground.
No one was injured and the jet, American Airlines Flight 1456, took off for Dallas shortly after without incident.
The FAA is now investigating, which "could result in a simple warning letter to a suspension of Ford's pilot's license," NBC reports.
Ford collects vintage planes and has been flying for decades. According to NPR's Russell Lewis, Ford is "a highly-skilled and highly-rated pilot. He's qualified to fly single and twin engine planes, sea planes, helicopters and he's also an instrument-rated pilot." In 2015, Ford said he owned "eight or nine various types of airplanes," according to NTSB documents posted on AirSafe.com.
Ford reported on a medical certificate application that he had logged at least 5,200 flight hours, according to the NTSB.
He was a 2008 honoree and received the Legends Aviation Legacy Award from Kiddie Hawk Air Academy, and subsequently had an award named after him.
Ford was seriously injured in March 2015 when he crash-landed a restored World War II-era trainer plane on a golf course near the Santa Monica Airport shortly after takeoff. A National Transportation Safety Board report found the crash was caused by a loose engine part.
In 2000, Ford's plane "departed" a runway in Lincoln, Neb., because of a gust of wind, according to AirSafe.com. He was flying a Beechcraft Bonanza which "sustained minor damage," though Ford and his passenger were not injured.
And in 1999 he crash-landed a helicopter during a training flight in Ventura County, near Los Angeles, according to the AP. "Although the helicopter rolled over on its left side, neither Ford or the instructor were injured," AirSafe.com notes.
New Zealand’s prime minister denied on Wednesday that he apologized for supporting a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israeli over “settlement construction”, saying his government still supports the resolution.

MOUNT LAUREL, N.J. (AP) — A New Jersey community has raised enough money to send a beloved school bus driver and die-hard Philadelphia Eagles fan to the Super Bowl.
A group of parents and students surprised Gary Kelmer with the present when he pulled up to the last stop on his bus route on Monday in Mount Laurel.
Parents Amy and Izaak Smith wanted to raise money as a way to thank "Mr. Gary" for his daily kindness. They raised more than $5,000 in just a few days on the fundraising site GoFundMe to send Kelmer and his wife to the Super Bowl in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Smiths purchased tickets, airfare and personalized jerseys for the couple.
A stunned Kelmer on Monday called it a "special dream come true" and exclaimed "I'm ecstatic."
Leighton Buzzard’s dismal away form continued on Saturday with a crushing 43-7 defeat at the hands of Old Northamptonians.
Home form has been keeping Buzzards’ heads afloat this season as they sit ninth in the table, but another disappointing performance on the road has prompted coach Tom Mowbray to demand more from his players.
“This was a very disappointing performance from us,” he said. “It was due to a number of things - things that can only be rectified on a Tuesday and Thursday.
“Let’s hope the boys will show some resilience in training and some bouncebackability on Saturday against high flying Paviors at Wright’s Meadow.”
The early stages against ON’s were competitive and played mostly in midfield - it took eight minutes for the home side to get into the Buzzards twenty-two but as soon as they did the Leighton defensive line was breached for the first converted try.
Whilst the majority of the play was in the Buzzard half, it took ON’s until the twenty-sixth minute to extend their lead.
A loose Buzzard pass gave the home side a chance to break away and good supporting lines secured their second try, which with the conversion, gave them a 14-0 lead.
A push-over try when Buzzards lost their own scrum five minutes later and then a penalty goal late in the half gave ON’s a 24-0 half time lead.
Leighton started the second half with renewed endeavour – a interception and a fifty metre break by Luke Stanbridge was stopped just short- when the ball was recycled it was knocked on to waste a fine attacking platform.
Similarly an excellent break by Jack Whitehouse came to nothing as a pass was adjudged forward. In between these two attacking moments, Buzzards had a conceded a fourth try, as the ball was lost in a tackle giving the home side a clear run to the line and extend their lead to 29-0.
Leighton were now playing with more speed – renewed energy from the replacements and the tactical move of Ollie Taylor to fly-half releasing Jack Whitehouse into more space in the centre, added to the attacking threat.
However just when Leighton were looking more threatening, a dropped ball gave the home team the opportunity to kick and chase the length of the pitch for a fifth try.
Despite this setback Buzzards attacked again and finally crossed the line for Leighton’s Frenchman Timothei Vampouille to score his first league try.
Ollie Taylor converted although there was time for O.N.’s to add a converted try to leave the final score 43-7.

SEATTLE (AP) — A Seattle-area man who was brought to the U.S. illegally as a child but was protected from deportation under a policy by President Barack Obama is suing the federal government over his arrest and detention last week.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested 23-year-old Daniel Ramirez Medina on Friday at his father's home. Agents were there to arrest his father and took Ramirez into custody even though he has a work permit under Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, court documents said.
ICE spokeswoman Rose Richeson said in a statement that Ramirez told agents he was a gang member and based on those statements and being a "risk to public safety," he was taken into custody.
Mark Rosenbaum, one of Ramirez's lawyers, responded that Ramirez "unequivocally denies being in a gang" and that the statement from Richeson is inaccurate.
"While in custody, he was repeatedly pressured by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to falsely admit affiliation," Rosenbaum said.
Northwest Immigrants Rights Project Legal Director Matt Adams told The Associated Press that Ramirez — who was brought to the U.S. from Mexico when he was 7 — has a job, a young son and no criminal record. Ramirez is being held in Tacoma, Washington.
Adams said Ramirez is the first person he knows of with DACA status who has been detained.
"This appears to be a complete one-off," Adams said. "We certainly haven't seen this with our other hundreds of clients who have DACA status as well."
Attorneys for Ramirez argue the arrest violates his constitutional rights to live and work in this country without the fear of arrest and deportation so long as he satisfies DACA requirements.
"Trust in our government depends upon the Executive Branch keeping its word," Rosenbaum, director of Public Counsel's Opportunity Under Law Project, said in a statement. "Bait and switch sullies the integrity of our nation's core values."
Emily Langlie, a spokeswoman for the US attorney's office in Seattle, said Tuesday afternoon it would be premature to comment on the lawsuit. A hearing in the case has been scheduled for Friday in federal court in Seattle.
Recent sweeps by U.S. immigration agents across multiple states have netted some immigrants with no criminal records, a departure from enforcement actions in the last decade. Under the Obama administration, agents focused more narrowly on individuals who posed a security or public safety threat.
President Donald Trump made illegal immigration a cornerstone of his campaign, saying he will build a wall along the Mexican border and deport millions of people, although actual plans have yet to be revealed. He has said he wants to focus on people who have committed crimes.
During an interview with Time magazine late last year, Trump expressed sympathy for the more than 740,000 people in the DACA program, which started in 2012.
"We're going to work something out that's going to make people happy and proud," he told the magazine.
Trump can withdraw the promised protection right away through an "operational memo" because Obama implemented it through one, William Stock, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said previously.
Adams said he believes Ramirez was apprehended by mistake.
"I don't think this has to do with any change in policy; I just think it was an enforcement procedure gone wrong," Adams said. "Hopefully they're going to come to their senses."
A manhunt is underway for a person of interest in the North Dallas shooting that injured two police officers and a civilian at a Home Depot, authorities said.911 dispatchers received a call to go to the Home Depot shortly after 4:12 p.m., Dallas Police Chief Renee Hall said in a press conference Tuesday night. After the responding officers arrived, a subsequent call for assistance was made after the shooting began.Two Dallas Police officers were critically wounded, the Dallas Police Department posted on Twitter shortly after the shooting. A civilian who is a loss prevention officer for Home Depot was also shot, Hall said. His or her condition is unknown at this time, police said.Police were actively searching for the person of interest in a nearby wooded area on Tuesday afternoon. Authorities identified him as 29-year-old Armando Juarez, who possibly left the location in a white pickup truck.Juarez is to be considered and dangerous, Hall said, adding that it is unclear "how he was able to get a gun and shoot all three of the victims."Hall asked the community to contact police if they see Juarez or have any information on who and where he is.The officers were transported by the Dallas Fire-Rescue Department to the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, where they are getting the "best possible care," Hall said.Hall did not release their names or an update on their conditions when speaking to the media out of respect for the families, she said.Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings described the aftermath of the shooting as a "two-front battle," referring to the victims' battles for their lives at the hospital as well as "the battle out in the community" to find the person of interest.The police department asked for prayers for the victims and their families."I want to ask each and every one of you for your prayers ... for our officers, for their families and for our entire DPD family, because we need you right now," Hall said. "Our hearts are very heavy."State, local and federal law enforcement agencies responded to the scene.In 2016, five Dallas law enforcement officers were shot and killed and seven more injured after they were ambushed by 25-year-old former Army reservist Micah Xavier Johnson . Johnson later died in a standoff with police.Former Dallas Police Chief and ABC News contributor David Brown said the most recent shooting on two Dallas police officers is "too much to bear for one department in such a short time frame.""Once again, it sobers us to realize what officers walk into day in and day out, how quickly they can become victims," Rawlings said.
Some things to know about mass shootings:
HOW IS 'MASS SHOOTING' DEFINED?
There is no concrete definition of "mass shooting." Most researchers who study mass shootings define it as four or more killed (excluding the shooter) in a public place. They do not count domestic violence cases that take place in the home nor do they include gang-related violence. That is also the definition used by the Congressional Research Service.
However, tucked into a law enacted by Congress in 2013 in the immediate aftermath of the Sandy Hook school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, to provide federal law enforcement assistance for active shooter situations was a description of mass killings as three or more killed.
Some other entities include cases in which four or more people are killed or injured.
ARE MASS SHOOTINGS HAPPENING MORE OFTEN?
Researchers say the number of mass shootings has remained fairly steady over the past three decades with occasional fluctuations. "Some years are worse than others and bad years tend to be followed by not so bad years," said James Alan Fox, a professor at Northeastern University in Boston who has been studying mass shootings since the early 1980s.
However, he and other researchers say it does appear that mass shootings have been deadlier in recent years. Since Sandy Hook, Americans have experienced five of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern U.S. history — two of those happening this year alone.
WHAT TYPE OF GUNS ARE USED IN MASS SHOOTINGS?
Researchers say the majority of mass shootings are carried out with handguns.
However, of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern U.S. history, half of them had a cache of firearms that included AR-style "assault weapons," one of them included an Uzi submachine gun, and the rest used standard rifles and/or handguns.
WHAT WEAPON WAS USED IN THE SANDY HOOK SHOOTING?
Adam Lanza, the gunman who killed 20 children and six adults at the school in Newtown, used a Bushmaster XM15. That firearm, made by Remington Arms, is an AR-style of firearm that was designed in a way to avoid being among the firearms prohibited by the decade-long "assault weapons" ban.
Relatives of the Sandy Hook victims allege in a lawsuit that the maker of the Bushmaster was negligent by marketing military-style weapons to young people who may be unstable and intent on inflicting mass casualties. The lawsuit against Remington Arms was dismissed because of broad immunity granted to the gun industry, but the Connecticut Supreme Court is weighing whether to reinstate it.
DETROIT (AP) — A proposed class-action lawsuit has been filed by three employees against Fiat Chrysler and United Auto Workers in connection with a federal corruption investigation.
The Detroit News and Detroit Free Press report Monday that the suit alleges union dues paid from 2009 to 2015 may have been spent on tainted or illegal bargaining.
Former Fiat Chrysler executive Al Iacobelli (IKE'-uh-belly) handled labor relations and admitted that he was trying to gain an advantage for the automaker. He has pleaded guilty to paying $1.5 million in cash and gifts to high-ranking UAW members.
Then-UAW vice president General Holiefield was charged in the case, but died in 2015. His wife also is charged.
The money for the scheme came from the UAW-Chrysler National Training Center in Detroit.
UAW denies the payments influenced contract bargaining.

Growing up in southwestern Virginia in recent decades, poet Molly McCully Brown often passed by a state institution in Amherst County that was once known as the "Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded."
Since 1983 the facility, which was founded in 1910, has been called the Central Virginia Training Center, and it is now a residential home for people with various intellectual disabilities. But in the early 20th century, the place Brown now refers to as "the colony" was part of the eugenics movement taking hold in the U.S., and a variety of treatments now considered inhumane were practiced there — including forced sterilization. Brown, who has cerebral palsy, notes that had she been born in an earlier era, she might have been sent to live at the institution herself.
"It is impossible to know that for sure," she says. "I can look at my life and look at my family and look at my parents and think, No, never. That never would have happened. But I also understand that if I had been born 50 years earlier, the climate was very different."
She hopes to give voice to those early generations of residents, in her book of poetry, The Virginia State Colony For Epileptics And Feebleminded.
For Brown, the themes of disability and poetry have been constant throughout her life: "In my life, there has always been my body in some state of falling apart or disrepair or attempting to be fixed, and there has always been poetry. And I couldn't untwine those things if I tried."
Interview Highlights
On seeing the buildings and grounds of the old facility
It was incredibly moving and incredibly powerful. The place is interesting because it is still an operational facility for adults with really serious disabilities, although it is in the process of closing. But like a lot of things in Virginia, it was initially built on an enormous amount of land. And, so, a really interesting thing happened, which is that as the buildings that were originally part of the colony fell into disrepair, they were largely just moved out of — and new buildings were built on accompanying land, but those original buildings were not necessarily torn down. So the place itself is this really strange combination of functioning facility and ghost town of everything that it has been. I've never been in a place that felt more acutely haunted in my life.
On how some people assume her physical disability means she also has an intellectual disability
We do have a strange tendency in this country to equate any kind of disability with less intellectual capability and with even a less complete humanity. Certainly as a child and as a teenager — and even now as an adult — [I] encountered people who assumed that just because I used a wheelchair, maybe I couldn't even speak to them. I often get questions directed at people I'm with, as opposed to me, and that's a really interesting phenomenon.
On the connection between poetry and theology
Both poetry and theology for me are about paying attention to the world in a very intentional way, and about admitting a mystery that is bigger than anything that I rationally understand. ... I think poetry has always been for me a kind of prayer. So those things feel very linked for me. And, again, poetry does feel like the first — and in some ways best — language I ever had for mystery and for my sense of what exists beyond the world we're currently living in.
On how Catholicism has helped her accept her body
One of the things that I find so moving about Catholicism is that it never forgets that to be a person is inherently and inescapably and necessarily to be in a body — a body that brings you pain, a body that brings you pleasure, a body that can be a barrier to thinking more completely about your life and your soul — but [that it] can also be a vehicle to delivering you into better communion with the world, with other people and to whatever divinity it is that you believe in.
What Catholicism did for me, in part, is give me a framework in which to understand my body as not an accident or a punishment or a mistake, but as the body that I am meant to have and that is constitutive of so much of who I am and what I've done and what I hope I will do in the world.
More and more ... I've come to see my body as a place of pride and potential, and as something that gives me a unique outlook onto the world. And I'd rather that, I guess, than be infuriated by it.
On her twin sister, who died shortly after birth
She lived about 36 hours after we were born. ... It's a phenomenon in my life that I have not a lot of rational explanation for, ... but it is true that I miss my sister with a kind of intense specificity that has no rational explanation, and that I feel aware of her presence in this way that I can't exactly explain or articulate, but which feels undeniable to me. ...
I do think that that sort of gave me no other option than to believe in some kind of something beyond this current mortal life that we're living. Because what is the explanation otherwise for the fact that I feel like I miss and I know this person who only lived a matter of hours? And for the fact as much as I know that she is dead and is gone in a real way, she doesn't feel "disappeared" to me.
On how her physical disability and her poetry are intertwined
I think the easiest way I have of describing it is I have two [early] memories. ... One of them is of sitting on a table in a hospital room in the children's hospital in St. Louis, choosing the flavor of the anesthetic gas I was going to breathe when they put me under to do my first major surgery. I was picking between cherry and butterscotch and grape. And the second memory that I have is of my father reading a Robert Hayden poem called "Those Winter Sundays."

TERRY GROSS, HOST:
This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. During the first half of the 20th century, many people in Virginia deemed mentally or physically defective were confined in the Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded, a government-run residential hospital where they were sterilized to prevent them from creating more people like themselves. The facility is now dedicated to training the cognitively impaired.
My guest, poet Molly McCully Brown, was born in 1991, grew up near this facility and often wondered if she would've been deemed defective and confined in the colony had she been born a few decades earlier. She has cerebral palsy, a neurological disorder that affects body movement and muscle coordination. Her new collection of poems, "The Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded," imagines what life was like in the colony. The poems were described in a New York Times book review as part history lesson, part seance, part ode to dread - beautiful and devastating.
As the daughter of two novelists, she grew up immersed in books. As we'll discuss later, Molly McCully Brown converted to Catholicism three years ago, although she describes her relationship to the church as uncomfortable. She's at work on a collection of essays about disability, poetry, religion and the American South.
Molly McCully Brown, welcome to FRESH AIR. I love your poems. So how often did you see the former Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded when you were driving around your home in Virginia?
MOLLY MCCULLY BROWN: You know, I drove by the entrance to the colony practically daily when I was a child and a teenager. But I never went inside of it until I was in college and home in Virginia from California for the summer, and starting to think about the Virginia landscape. And I took a kind of impromptu trip inside with a friend. So I'd driven by this place. I'd known about it for years and years - for my whole conscious life, basically. But I'd never seen it up until that point.
GROSS: What feeling did you get when you were inside?
BROWN: It was incredibly moving and incredibly powerful. The place is interesting because it is still an operational facility for adults with really serious disabilities, although it is in the process of closing. But like a lot of things in Virginia, it was initially built on an enormous amount of land. And so a really interesting thing happened, which is that, as the buildings that were originally part of the colony fell into disrepair, they were largely just moved out of. And new buildings were built on accompanying land. But those original buildings were not necessarily torn down.
And so the place itself is this really strange combination of functioning facility and ghost town of everything that it has been. And so I've never been in a place that felt more acutely haunted in my life.
GROSS: So I'd like you to read an excerpt of the opening poem from your book. This is the part of the poem where you're driving past the building that used to be the State Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded. You're driving past it, and you're thinking about the people who live there. You're thinking about what their lives have been like. And in this second part, you're also thinking about what it might have been like had you been forced to live there, as you might've been if you were born just a few decades earlier.
BROWN: Mmm hmm.
GROSS: Would you read it for us?
BROWN: Sure.
(Reading) I am my own kind of damaged there, looking out the right-hand window - spastic, palsied and off balance. I'm taking crooked notes about this place. It is the land where he is buried. The place she spent her whole life. The room where they made it impossible for her to have children. It is the colony where he did not learn to read but did paint every single slat of fence you see that shade of yellow, the place she didn't want to leave when she finally could because she'd lived there 50 years and couldn't drive a car, or remember the outside or trust anyone to touch her gently. And by some accident of luck or grace, some window less than half a century wide, it is my backyard but not what happened to my body.
GROSS: Do you think you would've been there, had you been born decades earlier?
BROWN: I mean, it is impossible to know that for sure, you know? And I can look at my life, and look at my family, and look at my parents and think, you know, no, never. That never would've happened. But I also understand that if I'd been born 50 years earlier, the climate was very different. The understanding of disability was very different. And what happens to people who are born with severe disabilities was a very different thing. And I think it is certainly a possibility. And that possibility is absolutely one of the things that led me to write the book.
GROSS: So when you were growing up with cerebral palsy, what were the assumptions made about you and your cognitive abilities when you were a child?
BROWN: You know, I feel very lucky that I grew up with parents who were phenomenal, and fierce and insistent advocates for me. And so who never let anyone assume that I was less cognitively capable - or really, less capable in any significant way - because I had cerebral palsy and my mobility was compromised. And they were wonderful about making sure that I was mainstreamed in the public school system as a child and had access to all the right kinds of educational opportunities.
But with that said, I think we do have strange tendency in this country to equate any kind of disability with less intellectual capability and with even a kind of less-complete humanity. And so I certainly, as a child, and as a teenager and even now as an adult, encountered people who assumed that just because I used a wheelchair, maybe I couldn't even speak to them. I often get questions directed at people that I'm with, as opposed to me. And that's a really interesting phenomenon.
GROSS: So the assumption that some of your poems are based on is not only were the people in this colony considered unfit to reproduce, therefore they were sterilized. It was assumed, in some ways, that they were, like, the outcasts of God. And that's why they were, quote, "defective."
So you have several poems that relate to faith, and religion and the people who are living in this colony. I'd like you to read one of those poems. It's called "The Convulsions Choir." And this is - I'm going to ask you to read an excerpt of that poem. Would you introduce it for us?
BROWN: Sure. So this poem is called "The Convulsions Choir." And it's from the point of view of an imagined colony patient who is epileptic. And I'm just going to read the very first part of the poem, which takes place in the colony's chapel.
(Reading) They did not build the church for us. I overheard one night nurse talking to another. They meant it for the staff, as a refuge from the stench, the idiot and the insane. They meant, you will need God more than ever in this place. After all, we are a whole host of reasons to stop believing in anything. I am the worst thing the reasoned world has wrought.
GROSS: Is that poem based on things that you learned in researching the colony, that the church was really built for the staff and not for the people who were permanent residents of the colony?
BROWN: I don't know that I ever came upon a sort of direct statement of that fact. But what I did come upon again and again was a kind of understanding that was pervasive in the colony and in the eugenics movement in the '30s, at the time that these poems are set, that the people who were colony patients, colony inmates, were somehow subhuman, somehow not fully possessed of meaningful inner lives and meaningful consciousnesses that were developed to the same extent as, you know, somebody who was considered not defective by the times of society at that moment might have been.
And from there, it felt like a really kind of easy conclusion for me to imagine that these spaces which are about the kind of cultivation of one's inner-life, of one's soul, if you want to call it that, of one's relationship with whatever higher power one might believe in couldn't have and wouldn't have been imagined for these patients but did exist on colony grounds.
And so from there, I kind of extrapolated to this point where I tried to imagine, OK, if you don't really believe that these patients are possessed of a complete inner-life and are possessed of a sort of capacity to be concerned with their own soul, then who are you building a church for here, and why?
GROSS: You have another poem that's written from the perspective of a priest or a minister at the church in the colony. And I'd like you to read an excerpt of that one for us and to...
BROWN: Sure.
GROSS: ...Introduce it as well.
BROWN: Yeah. So it was important to me in writing the book that I tried to imagine not just the perspectives of women who would have been colony patients but also people who might have and would have worked there. And so this is one of those poems, as you said, from the perspective of preacher, a minister who works at the colony, trying to kind of grapple with his own relationship to the place and the people and the work that he was doing there. And I'm just going to read the first two sections.
"Prayer For The Wretched Among Us." One. (Reading) Always they tell you to go where God calls you. What they don't say is that sometimes God will call you to the wilderness, gesture toward the trees and then hang back and wave you on alone. This is how I wound up granting absolution to low-grade idiots and the worn-out women who turn them over in bed at night and at dawn go home to their own families. Try not to think of ghosts wasting away in the world.
Two. (Reading) You are not supposed to be afraid of sinners. You should take off your shoes and give them to the wretched and the damned. Hold out your hand to every girl, even if she seems more animal, statue or remnant of plague than lost disciple. But do the children of God really lose their eyes in the backs of their heads and swallow their own tongues in church?
GROSS: That's Molly McCully Brown reading one of her poems from her new collection, "The Virginia State Colony For Epileptics And Feebleminded." Molly, let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is poet Molly McCully Brown. Her new collection of poems is called "The Virginia State Colony For Epileptics And Feebleminded." We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF KEVIN EUBANKS' "POET")
GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. If you're just joining us, my guest is poet Molly McCully Brown. Her new collection is called "The Virginia State Colony For Epileptics And Feebleminded." The poems are inspired by the institution that was just a few miles away from where she grew up that used to house people deemed to be insane, idiotic, feebleminded or epileptic. Those are the words that we used then. And then they were sterilized to prevent them from reproducing. Brown has cerebral palsy and often has to use a wheelchair. She thinks that had she been born just a few decades earlier, she might have ended up in the colony or been sterilized there.
Molly, you converted to Catholicism a few years ago. You know, Christ's body is an essential part of Mass. The wafer and the wine and Holy Communion is meant to be the body and the blood of Jesus. I'm wondering if it's significant for you that the body of Jesus is such a part of the Mass given that your body has been such a defining trait for you your whole life because of its limitations and because of the pain it's caused you and the attention it gets from people who see you, you know, either in a wheelchair or walking with difficulty.
BROWN: Absolutely. I think one of the central things that drew me to Catholicism in the beginning was how central and significant the body is in the Mass both in terms of, yes, that understanding that Christ body is literally present as part of the service and also in terms of how bodily the Mass is and how bodily the theology is.
I think we have this tendency to think of religion as something which is about leaving the body behind, right? You have a soul. You have a spiritual life that is somehow utterly untethered from the fact that you are a flesh-and-blood person moving around in the world and limited and constituted by your body in all of these unavoidable ways.
And one of the things that I find so moving about Catholicism is that it never forgets that to be a person is inherently and inescapably and necessarily to be in a body, a body that brings you pain, a body that brings you pleasure, a body that can be a barrier to thinking more completely about your life and your soul but that can also be a vehicle to delivering you into better communion with the world, with other people and to whatever divinity it is that you believe in.
GROSS: Jesus was also a healer of the sick. Does that speak to you?
BROWN: Absolutely - I mean I think for me, that's a kind of complicated question. One thing that I found really meaningful as I was going through the process of converting - and I should say that I still - even as a convert, I have an uncomfortable relationship with some things about the church, and I have many questions. And I think for me, being a person of faith is about trying to live with that - inside those questions and sort of, you know, help be a part of making the institutions that I am a part of and believe in the best versions of themselves.
But one thing that I did find enormously interesting and moving as I was converting to Catholicism was this notion that we all have the bodies that we are meant to have and that if and when Christ in the Bible heals the sick, we're to understand it only as a part of doing something that is in some way necessary for the maintenance and salvation of their spirits and their souls.
And so actually what Catholicism did for me in part is give me a framework in which to understand my body as not an accident or a punishment or a mistake but as the body that I am meant to have and that is constitutive of so much of who I am and what I've done and what I hope I will do in the world.
More and more I've come to see - whether I'm in church or in the classroom as a teacher or interacting with people I love, I've come to see my body as a place of pride and potential and as something which gives me a unique outlook onto the world. And I'd rather that, I guess, than be infuriated by it.
GROSS: Could you tell us just a little bit about your condition of cerebral palsy?
BROWN: Yeah. So cerebral palsy is a neurological disorder. And the easiest way to describe it is that it's a little bit like a stroke that happens usually in utero or immediately after birth. And one of the most common causes of the type that I have, which is called moderate spastic diplegia, is oxygen deprivation. And it just essentially results in brain damage, which impairs your gross motor control, your balance and, in my case, results in heightened spasticity, which means that my muscles are really, really tense and really tight. Cerebral palsy is a big umbrella of a disorder. There are people who have cerebral palsy who are affected so severely that it inhibits their speech. It inhibits the motion of their hands. It means that they kind of don't walk at all.
And there are people who have CP, which is the abbreviation, who are really pretty mildly affected and might be a little bit clumsy, have a slight - a gait that looks, you know, slightly other than what you might typically expect. I fall somewhere in the middle of that spectrum. So I walk with a very crouched gait. My balance is very bad. And my endurance is very limited. And that means that I use a wheelchair to walk more than sort of very short distances.
GROSS: So when you were born, you were very premature.
BROWN: I was.
GROSS: How premature?
BROWN: I was born at 27 weeks, which is almost three months premature.
GROSS: And you were born one of a twin.
BROWN: I was. I was an identical twin, yeah.
GROSS: And your twin sister died just a few hours after being born.
BROWN: She died. She lived about 36 hours after she was born.
GROSS: And my understanding is, from reading your writing - is it the concept of soul - of the soul - is especially important to you because you feel like you're still in touch with your sister's soul, that your sister had a soul and there's something of her that lives on and that you are interconnected with.
BROWN: Yeah. It's a funny thing because it is a phenomenon in my life that I have not a lot of rational explanation for - that there is not a lot of language or space that feels right for discussing it in the kind of daily, practical life of being a human being. But it is true that I miss my sister with a kind of intense specificity that has no rational explanation and that I feel aware of her presence in this way that I can't exactly explain or articulate but which feels undeniable to me. And I have my whole life, ever since I was a child.
And so, yeah, I do think that that sort of gave me no other option than to believe in some kind of something beyond this current mortal life that we're living - because what is the explanation otherwise for the fact that I feel like I miss and I know this person who only lived a matter of hours and for the fact that, as much as, you know, I know that she is dead and is gone in a very real way she doesn't feel disappeared to me?
GROSS: So is church this space? And does it provide the language for you to think about things like your sister's soul?
BROWN: It does. For me, church and Catholicism specifically does provide some of that space and some of that language. And I should say that the other thing that provides that space for me is poetry - and that, for me, those things feel very twinned (ph), for lack of a better term and that I think I came to religion, to theology first and largely through relationship to poetry. That has lasted my whole life and has been always the first and best language for me for talking about things that I can't exactly explain or that don't really have a place in the kind of daily, normal life that I'm living.
GROSS: My guest is Molly McCully Brown. Her new collection of poems is called "The Virginia State Colony For Epileptics And Feebleminded." After we take a short break, we'll talk about how poetry connects with her faith and about being the daughter of two novelists. And jazz critic Kevin Whitehead will review a 1968 concert recording by the Bill Evans Trio that's been released for the first time. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with poet and essayist Molly McCully Brown. Her new collection of poems, The Virginia State Colony For Epileptics And Feebleminded," takes its title from the government-run residential hospital which, in the first half of the 20th century, housed people deemed to be mentally or physically defective. To prevent them from procreating, they were sterilized. Brown grew up near the facility and wonders if she'd have been sent there had she been born decades earlier. She has cerebral palsy, a neurological disorder that affects body movement and muscle coordination. When we left off, we were talking about her recent conversion to Catholicism.
Tell me more - how poetry connected you with theology.
BROWN: I think, for me, both writing and reading poetry and experiencing religious devotion are always first and foremost for me, a matter of sort of slowing down and stilling and paying attention and quieting that sort of indignant, protesting part of my heart that says, you know, I'm angry or I don't understand this or I am hungry or I want to be watching whatever bad reality television show is airing right now - that both poetry and theology for me are about paying attention to the world in a very intentional way and about admitting a mystery that is bigger than anything that I rationally understand or bigger than who I am as a person. And I think, you know, poetry has always been for me a kind of prayer. And so those things feel very linked for me. And, again, poetry does feel like the first and, in some ways, best language I ever had for mystery and for my sense of what exists beyond the world that we're currently living in.
GROSS: Your parents are both writers. They're novelists, and they're teachers at Sweet Briar College in Virginia. You grew up on a house either on the campus or just near the campus?
BROWN: I grew up on campus, yeah.
GROSS: Was that a good thing?
BROWN: Oh, it was a wonderful thing. For a bookish, weird child who had to spend a lot of time in hospitals, had to spend a lot of time in physical therapy, found early that her brain was going to be her best refuge and best resource, growing up the children of artists and faculty members on a college campus - I mean, it was like Mecca. I got to go to readings. I got to go to classes. My life was filled with people who took my interest in books and in art and in religion and in poetry seriously from my earliest moments. It was - I could not have asked for a better childhood in that way.
GROSS: And it sounds like you were really serious about writing right at the start. I mean, from reading your essays, it sounds like you were dictating things to your parents before you knew how to write...
BROWN: Yeah.
GROSS: ...Because you had such a strong urge to write down what you were saying. Like, can you describe that urge?
BROWN: Yeah. I mean, I think the easiest way I have of describing it is that I have two memories, one of which is my first memory and one of which is my second. And I couldn't tell you which one comes first and which one comes second. One of them is of sitting on a table in a hospital room in the children's hospital in St. Louis, choosing the flavor of the anesthetic gas I was going to breathe when they put me under to do my first major surgery. And I was picking between cherry and butterscotch and grape.
And the second memory that I have - very early memory I have - is of my father reading a Robert Hayden poem called "Those Winter Sundays." And so I guess the thing to say is that in my life, there has always been my body in some state of falling apart or disrepair or attempting to be fixed. And there has always been poetry. And I couldn't untwin those things if I tried. But I have wanted to be a writer since I - yeah, since before I could write. I have never really wanted to do anything else.
And I - you know, I can remember discovering a copy of Emily Dickinson's poems in my mother's bedroom at maybe 7 or 8 years old and reading them and, of course, not really understanding them but being drawn to the music and the compression and the strangeness of them and thinking, that. I want to do that. And I'm very lucky that I've gotten to.
GROSS: Are there are a few lines from Dickinson you want to say that meant a lot to you when you were discovering her?
BROWN: Yeah. The soul has moments of escape when bursting all the doors. She dances like a bomb, abroad, and swings upon the hours.
GROSS: What did that mean to you?
BROWN: Oh. I think that, for me, Dickinson was the first poet I encountered who I could see really clearly grappling with the sort of difficult yoke between body and soul and the relationship that they had to one another. And that notion that the soul has moments of escape when bursting all the doors - and there for me you got the soul bursting the bounds of the body. But you also got a kind of magical experience of being alive. And those lines do, I mean, have about them the thing that poetry has - right? - which is that they have not just their narrative meaning. But they have all that great and wonderful sound. You know, the soul has moments of escape when bursting all the doors. She dances like a bomb abroad and swings upon the hours. All those B's, all that swinging sound - the way in which the message of the poem felt so in conversation to me with the way that it sounded and the way that it was on the page. I think I thought, OK, this is my language.
GROSS: My guest is Molly McCully Brown. Her new collection of poems is called "The Virginia State Colony For Epileptics And Feebleminded." We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF AVISHAI COHEN'S "GBEDE TEMIN")
GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with writer Molly McCully Brown. Her new collection of poems, "The Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded," takes its title from the government-run residential hospital which, in the first half of the 20th century, housed people deemed physically or cognitively defective. She grew up near the facility and empathizes with the patients because she has cerebral palsy.
I've been choosing poems for you to read. Would you like to choose one that you would like to read?
BROWN: Sure. I'd love to read one of the first poems in the first section of the book, which is called "In The Dormitory." This is a poem called "Grand Mal Seizure," and it's the first poem that I ever wrote for the collection as I was drafting it. And it's one that - its beginning became, for me, a kind of way of thinking about what I was doing in the collection as a whole and my relationship to this place and these poems. So I'd love to read that.
GROSS: Go ahead.
BROWN: "Grand Mal Seizure" - (Reading) There's however it is you call, and there's whatever it is you're calling to. July, I sew my own dress from calico and lace. August, they take it off me in the colony, trade it in for standard-issue Virginia cotton - not much room for my body in the heavy slip. Maybe that's the idea. For a while, the abandoning was rare. And then it was not and would never be again. Imagine you are an animal in your own throat. The dormitory has a pitched, dark roof and a high porch. We are not allowed outside.
Instead, we go to the window and make a game of racing dogwood blossoms knocked down by the wind. Choose your flower as it falls, and see whose is the first to hit the clay. I beat the crippled girl every day for a week. The trick is to pick the smaller petals. Most nights, they knot the bedsheet in my mouth so I will not bite my tongue. Lay out on the pine floor, rattle your own bones back to the center of the world. In the beds, the smell of kerosene and lye - the girls wake themselves one after another - spasm, whimper, whine. Outside, cicadas; in the distance, the big house lights - another truck comes loud up the road bearing another girl. There is whatever it is you're calling to. There is however it is you call.
GROSS: Thank you for reading that. I think language has so much to do with how you explain ourselves to ourselves and to others. And I'm thinking, like, if you grew up - if somebody grew up in this colony for the, quote, "feebleminded and epileptics," and you were labeled, officially, defective and you were sterilized because you were defective, that you would have to think of yourself as defective. I mean, that's how - that was your official diagnosis - defective.
BROWN: Absolutely.
GROSS: Whereas, like, when you were growing up with cerebral palsy, a condition that might've ended you up in this colony had you been born decades ago, you were given a medical explanation. Here's what happened in your body when you were born, and here is why your muscles aren't typical. Did you think about that a lot when writing the book - how language defines how you see yourself and how others see you?
BROWN: Absolutely. I mean, I think one thing that it's worth saying - you know, I owe a lot to modern medicine and to the medical model of disability. This model that says, OK, here are the things that are, quote, unquote, "wrong with you." Here are the reasons, as far as we know them, that they're wrong with you. And here are the things we can do and are going to try to do to fix you. You know, I've had several major surgeries in my life. I've had a lot of orthopedic intervention. And I am certainly more mobile than I would be without that intervention. And I'm - am grateful for all of that.
And I'm grateful to have had these scientific and concrete explanations for why and how my body works, and my brain works or doesn't work the way that it does. But I will say that it does shape your sense of yourself. You know, the earliest language I had for talking about my body was a list of the things that were wrong with it and a list of the things that people were doing to try to make it like, quote, unquote, "better." And I think that does really shape your sense of who you are.
You know, you come into the world learning to talk about yourself and your body from a place of needing to be fixed. And so you do think, OK, by default, here I am, broken. And here are the ways in which I need to be made better, made more capable. And that is a really complicated set of things to grapple with as a young person. And so I can only imagine how much worse and more pervasive it would have been if the language you were given for yourself was idiot, was imbecile, was feebleminded because you're right. We are shaped by the stories we are told about ourselves.
GROSS: What was that list of words that defined you when you were young?
BROWN: So I knew very early on that I had cerebral palsy. I knew that my specific diagnosis was moderate spastic dysplasia. I knew that I had high muscle tone. I knew that I had a crouched gait. I knew that my fine motor control was impaired, and my gross motor control was impaired. I knew that my balance was impaired. I knew that my hamstrings were especially tight and my heel cords were especially tight. I knew that I'd had a neurological surgery called a dorsal rhizotomy. And I knew roughly what that was. I knew what an orthotic was. And I knew that there were various kinds of them. That language of monitoring, and maintenance, and defect and attempted repair belonged to me remarkably young. What other 5-year-old do you know that can say dorsal rhizotomy?
GROSS: Really (laughter).
BROWN: Yeah.
GROSS: In one of your essays, you kind of ask the question, when is it appropriate to tell people that you have cerebral palsy, that you're often in a wheelchair? When do you tell a potential employee? When do you tell a potential boyfriend? Like, say you're meeting the person for the first time at a restaurant, and you're already seated. And that person doesn't necessarily know. Has your opinion about that changed over the years?
BROWN: Oh, I think my opinion about that changes every 35 seconds.
GROSS: (Laughter).
BROWN: ...Based on how it is that I am feeling or who it is that I'm interacting with on a given day. I like to think I'm getting better at navigating the question of disclosure. You know, I'm in this kind of complicated space when it comes to that because, obviously, the moment that you see me stand up or you see me walk, you know that I'm disabled. It is absolutely sort of visually unavoidable. But you don't necessarily know if you just see me sitting at a desk in a classroom or sitting at a table in a restaurant. And so there is this sort of initial moment of, OK, how do you disclose? What do you do?
But, you know, in some ways, I think I am helped by the fact that that moment can only be a moment because the moment I want to move, I have no choice but to deal with the fact that my body announces that truth about itself to the world. And learning how to grapple with that, learning what to say about it, learning how to navigate people's reactions to it was a sort of process that evolved over the course of my childhood and my adolescence, and is still evolving as I'm an adult.
GROSS: So when you think back to your childhood, do you think about how your body was weak, your body needed constant repair, but that your mind was strong?
BROWN: Yeah, I mean, I think even - it's so interesting for me now, as an adult and a writer, to think about the kinds of binaries that I instituted for myself in terms of who I was and what was valuable about me and what was wrong with me. You know, I think there's something sort of already problematic when we say, like, OK, you have a bad body. You have a weak body, but you have a strong mind - because, first of all, you know, what does it mean to be weak or to be strong? What does it mean to have a valuable mind? How are we defining that?
I think it is a really - that's still a really fraught and complicated territory that bears the vestiges of this kind of fear about people who were less intellectually capable, who were in some way going to sort of limit the progress of humanity because they were less strong, less good, somehow defective. And I think it's interesting for me to think about how our language about that, our way of thinking about that still carries the vestiges of that history in it. It's also interesting for me because I think I did - and I do, you know, take great pleasure in my capability with language and my ability to read and my love and appreciation for art - all of that was incredibly important to me.
And I definitely did have this pervasive sense of myself as a child as someone who was not physically capable. But that was OK because I was really, really smart. And, of course, the ways in which that had been complicated in my adult life - by my understanding that actually everything that is wrong with my body is a consequence of damage to my brain - so that, actually, the problem, if you want to call it that, is in my head and is the same brain that has delivered me so many of the things that are most joyful about my life, that are most useful and wonderful about who I am as a person. That is the site, too, of so many of the ways in which I struggle. And I think figuring out how to come to terms with that - how to grapple with the simultaneous truth of both of those things - is the sort of ongoing project of my life.

NEW YORK (AP) — In Washington, even a name change is fraught with political drama.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is pushing to be referred to as the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, a surface level, but notable change for the agency tasked with protecting consumers against debt collectors and banks.
Officials say the change reflects the bureau's legal name, but critics say it underscores the abrupt ideological turn the bureau has taken since Trump-appointee Mick Mulvaney took over. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act did create a "Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection" but that name has rarely been used, except occasionally in court filings.
Under Mulvaney, the bureau has proposed revisiting the regulations and policies the Obama administration put in place, and has also reduced the number of enforcement actions it has taken.
CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Cam Newton apologized Thursday night in a Twitter video post for sexist comments made to a female reporter.
“After careful thought, I understand that my word choice was extremely degrading and disrespectful to women,” the Carolina Panthers quarterback said at the start of the nearly two-minute video. “To be honest, that was not my intentions. And if you are a person who took offense to what I said, I sincerely apologize to you.”
On Wednesday when Charlotte Observer reporter Jourdan Rodrigue asked the 2015 NFL MVP about wide receiver Devin Funchess’ route running, Newton laughed and said, “It’s funny to hear a female talk about routes. It’s funny.”
In the video, Newton said he’s a man who strives to be a positive role model in the community and who tries to use his platform to inspire others. He said he takes ownership to everything that comes with that.
“What I did was extremely unacceptable,” Newton said. “I’m a father to two beautiful daughters and I try to instill in them that they can be anything that they want to be. The fact that during this process I have already lost sponsors and countless fans I realize that the joke is really on me. I have really learned a valuable lesson from this.”
Newton also sent a message to the “young people” who follow him.
“Don’t be like me,” Newton said. “Be better than me. To the reporters, to the journalists, to the moms, the super moms, the daughters, the sisters all around the world I sincerely apologize and hope that you can find the kindness in your heart to forgive me. Thank you.”
The NFL quickly released a statement Wednesday saying that Newton’s response to the question was “just plain wrong and disrespectful to the exceptional female reporters and all journalists who cover our league.”
However, it doesn’t appear there will be any punishment handed out to Newton.
“I think there are conversations going on at the club level with the appropriate people, with the Panthers,” NFL spokesman Joe Lockhart said in a conference call Thursday. “I don’t want to anticipate the league stepping in there.”
Newton’s remarks have proven costly.
Dannon, the maker of Oikos yogurt, cut ties with spokesman Newton on Thursday. Company spokesman Michael Neuwirth released a statement saying it was “shocked and disheartened” at the former league MVP’s behavior and comments.
Panthers coach Ron Rivera addressed the situation briefly during his press conference Thursday, saying, “I think Cam made a mistake. I understand he had a conversation where he pretty much said he shouldn’t have said what he said.”
Rodrigue issued a statement Wednesday evening saying she and Newton did speak after the news conference, but said the quarterback didn’t apologize for his remarks.
Rodrigue was back in the locker room Thursday, flanked by Mike Persinger, the executive sports editor of The Charlotte Observer.
She issued an apology herself Thursday after coming under fire for using a racial slur in tweets she posted about four years ago. The tweets were first reported by BlackSportsOnline.com.
“I apologize for the offensive tweets form my Twitter account from 4/5 years ago,” Rodrigue said on her Twitter account. “There is no excuse for these tweets and the sentiment behind them. I am deeply sorry and apologize.”
Rodrigue was a college student at Arizona State at the time of the tweets. When asked about the tweets, Persinger said “she has owned them and apologized for them.”
Newton’s teammate, Thomas Davis, said he doesn’t think the issue will affect the team as it prepares for the game against Detroit on Sunday.
“He’s going to have to deal with that moving forward,” Davis said about Newton. “I feel like it’s a situation he’s going to handle and he’s going to handle it well. But for us as a football team we’ll remain focused on Detroit.”
Persinger said Wednesday evening that Newton’s comments were “unfortunate and out of line.”
The Associated Press Sports Editors announced that it “agrees wholeheartedly that Mr. Newton’s response was out of line” and “we ask for a formal apology to Jourdan Rodrigue from Mr. Newton and the Carolina Panthers organization.”
LONDON (AP) — British police say couple who are critically ill were exposed to Russian nerve agent Novichok.
NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) – Police are investigating a vicious dog attack that was caught on camera in the subway.
A pit bull latched onto a passenger’s foot and wouldn’t let go.
Now, people are wondering why the animal was on the train in the first place.
Witnesses told CBS2’s Ali Bauman from the moment the dog got onto the busy subway car, they could feel the tension. Its owner only had it on a leash, which is against MTA rules.
Video shows commuters circling around the pit bull with its teeth tightly clenched around a woman’s shoe. Her leg twists as the dog tugs on her foot.
It happened around 3 p.m. Friday on the 4 train approaching Wall Street.
Tahysi Kyng recorded the video and said it all started when the dog’s owner sat his pet on the seat next to the woman.
“She’s like, ‘the dog doesn’t belong on the seat.’ He’s like, ‘I’m not moving my dog,’” said Kyng.
“She pushes it like, ‘What is this dog doing on the chair?’ And he’s like, ‘do not push my dog.’ And she does it one more time, and he just goes swinging,” another witness Denise Leon added.
Kyng said the woman and dog owner started fighting, with the pit bull still between them.
“He’s jumping on her, but she moves back. That’s when he catches hold of her shoe and he was not letting it go,” said Leon.
Other riders kept their distance as the owner wrestled the dog off by its collar. He then threw the woman’s shoe back at her.
“At the same time, you want to help her, but you don’t want the dog to turn on you,” Leon said.
“He never told the dog to let her go at all,” said Kyng.
The MTA allows dogs on subway cars but they must be contained to a carrying case. A spokesperson told CBS2 the video is “disturbing and a clear violation of our rules.”
“Big dogs are not supposed to be on the train,” Leon said. “I just wanted to know if she was OK.”
Kyng said the conductor made everyone get off the train at the next stop. He didn’t get a chance to ask the woman if she was alright, but she was able to walk and didn’t appear to be bleeding.
The NYPD and MTA are investigating.
Dustin Johnson hits a drive on the 12th hole during a practice round for the U.S. Open golf tournament Wednesday, June 14, 2017, at Erin Hills in Erin, Wis. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip)
ERIN, Wis. (AP) -- Dustin Johnson has been in complete control of his golf game during his rise to No. 1.
But at home?
Paulina Gretzky calls the shots, especially when it comes to naming their children.
Johnson revealed Monday that their second child, another boy, was named River Jones Johnson. Asked where the name River came from, he said, ''Mama.''
The middle name was easy to explain. Jones is the maiden name of Gretzky's mother (Janet Jones), and the last name of Johnson's late grandmother (Carole Jones), his biggest influence during his teenage years.
But back to River. What was Paulina thinking?
''I can't think how she thinks, that's for sure,'' Johnson said. ''I don't know where she got it. I tried to ask. She said, 'I don't know, I just like the name.'''
They plan on calling him Riv, which is how several people refer to Riviera. That's where Johnson won big this year at the Genesis Open to reach No. 1 in the world and start his three-tournament winning streak.
So maybe there's something to that.
''That was how she got started was from Riviera,'' Johnson said. ''But I didn't come up with that on my own.''

WHAT WILL PHIL DO NEXT?: Bad news for Phil Mickelson without even being at Erin Hills: The forecast calls for a reasonable chance of storms for all but one day this week - Thursday, when he'll be in California for his daughter's high school graduation.
Mickelson has yet to withdraw, saying he will need a four-hour delay in the first round of the U.S. Open to have any chance of flying to Wisconsin (more than three hours in the air) and getting to the first tee.
He is to play at 2:20 p.m. in Wisconsin. Graduation is noon (Wisconsin time).
At least his caddie, Jim ''Bones'' Mackay, made it to Erin Hills to scout the course on the rare chance of Mickelson making it to the U.S. Open. Mackay thinks Erin Hills is perfect for Mickelson, mainly because of wide fairways and the need for a great short game.
''He wants it, obviously, as badly as he wants anything else,'' Mackay told Fox Sports. ''So it would be a really cool thing if it worked out for him tomorrow. Knowing Phil and knowing how much he wants to play, it wouldn't surprise me if he left if rain wasn't in the forecast. You never know out here with this kind of humidity. Storms can roll up unexpectedly.
''I'm leaving him alone, but it wouldn't surprise me if he left, flew a little bit and then if the guys tee off at 2:20, turn around and go home.''

RING THE BELL: In a sunken patch of rough, just beyond the seventh tee box at Erin Hills, stands a rusted-out bell with the clapper removed.
When Erin Hills was first built, the bell stood near the green on what was then a blind par-3. Since the putting surface was not in sight from the tee box, players had to ring the bell to let the next group know the green was clear. A white rock behind the green was positioned every day to indicate the aiming point for the day's pin position.
The hole was nicknamed the ''Dell Hole,'' after a similar hole at Lahinch Golf Club in Ireland.
But during one of the course redesigns, then-owner Bob Lang ordered the area in front of the green bulldozed to make room for a new set of tees, and what had been the eighth hole was lengthened and turned into the new par-5 seventh.
''It was a unique hole,'' said Steve Stricker, the Wisconsin native who was invited to play Erin Hills in the early days.
In the end, he agreed with Lang, who felt the USGA would never bring a U.S. Open to a course with a blind par-3.
Fortunate, then, that Erin Hills was originally built with 19 holes. What is now the par-3 ninth used to be called the ''Bye Hole'' - playable but didn't count on the scorecard.
Stricker said he always thought that was the better of those par-3s.
''So I don't know if that stuck with them or they thought the same thing,'' he said. ''But I wasn't a big fan of the blind par-3.''

SLOGAN TWEAK: For years, the U.S. Open has been referred to as the ''toughest test in golf.'' So it was interesting to hear USGA executive director Mike Davis refer to it on more than one occasion as the ''ultimate test in golf.''
That was a conscious decision.
''We really got branded as the toughest test not by ourselves but by others,'' Davis said. ''It's not necessarily bad. And we're not shunning the fact that it is a tough test. We get to the Women's Open it's going to be a tough test. There's history, well over a century of history of that with the USGA. But I will tell you when we sit and talk as a group and we're setting a golf course up, we are never - never - talking about, 'We have to have even par win' or 'We have to make this as tough as possible.''

LONDON (AP) — A senior BBC journalist who quit her post to protest the gender pay gap says management is hurting the corporation's credibility by failing to address the issue.
Carrie Gracie, the broadcaster's former China editor, says BBC managers have treated women who speak out about pay "as some sort of enemy."
Tensions over pay flared last summer when the BBC released a list of top earners that showed many high-profile women earned far less than their male counterparts.
She told a committee of lawmakers on Wednesday that management's failure to address the problem was "damaging the credibility of the BBC in a completely unacceptable way."
Gracie resigned from her post in early January, after learning that male colleagues in similar jobs had much higher salaries.

U.S. President reacts to release of memo alleging abuse of government surveillance powers by Justice Department.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday reacted to the release of a previously classified memo alleging abuse of government surveillance powers by the Justice Department, saying the memo “totally vindicates" him and adding the Russia investigation as “an American disgrace”, reports The Hill.
“This memo totally vindicates 'Trump' in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on,” Trump tweeted. “Their [sic] was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace!”
The president later tweeted, “Great jobs numbers and finally, after many years, rising wages- and nobody even talks about them. Only Russia, Russia, Russia, despite the fact that, after a year of looking, there is No Collusion!”
The memo, released Friday, accuses senior Justice Department officials of improperly using information from the so-called Steele dossier to obtain surveillance warrants on Carter Page, a member of the Trump transition team and former Trump adviser.
The document claims that although the FBI had "clear evidence" that the author of the dossier, former British spy Christopher Steele, was biased against then-candidate Trump, it did not convey this to the surveillance court when making its warrant applications.
The memo alleges that the political origins of the dossier — partially paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) — were not disclosed to the clandestine court that signed off on the warrant request.
Trump on Friday approved the release of the memo, despite objections from top officials at the FBI and Justice Department. He called its revelations disgraceful.
“I think it’s a disgrace,” he told reporters. "A lot of people should be ashamed of themselves."
The FBI, for its part, warned that it had “grave concerns” about the accuracy of the document.
"The FBI takes seriously its obligations to the FISA Court and its compliance with procedures overseen by career professionals in the Department of Justice and the FBI," the FBI said in its statement. "We are committed to working with the appropriate oversight entities to ensure the continuing integrity of the FISA process."
Town progressed to the semi-finals of the Buckingham Charity Cup with a very laboured performance on Tuesday night against a very hard working Unite MK 2-1 in Bletchley.
Town were by far the better side and created many more chances than their young opponents who worked very hard but were not able to create many real goal scoring opportunities .
Unite could have scored when a header went over the bar when a better directed effort would surely have found the net . Although Leighton had the greater share of possession they failed to really trouble the home keeper.
Town went ahead when Tom Silford beat the 'keeper from close range and this should have set them on the way to victory but a scrambled effort drew their hosts level. Substitute James Hatch got the winner near the end and Town played out the final minutes without any scares.
Although Town started this game without seven regular first team players, manager Reynolds needs to work hard to have the entire squad up for games of this nature if they are to continue to challenge for honours this season.
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- University of Texas officials are inviting companies to submit proposals to build and operate an on-campus basketball facility to replace the 40-year old Frank Erwin Center.
School officials want a public-private partnership with minimal financial investment from the school. The arena would also be available for concerts and other public events.
The Erwin Center will eventually be demolished to make room for the expanding campus medical school. School officials said they want bids from companies with experience working with universities and building facilities that cost $350 million to $450 million at a minimum.
The announcement did not say how many seats school officials want it to have. The Erwin Center holds close to 16,500 for basketball.
Springtime Tournaments
Spring is the season for rod-bending action, because gamefish leave their winter haunt for the flats and estuaries.
Many fishing tournaments kick off in spring such as King of the Beach, My Warriors Place and several Grand Slam Tournaments. Ana Banana Fishing Company likes to compete in all of them. Following is how we like to fish them in the spring.
King of the Beach: We have placed in this tournament several years, and won first place in 2012. Some years, the kingfish are deep out in the Gulf; or, shallower nearshore or even in the bay. It all depends on weather and bait. Water clarity also plays a big part of where the kings are–we usually find them in the clearest water. We like to slow troll or drift ladyfish and/or Spanish mackerel. For our win in 2012, we were fishing the 90 foot hole off Egmont Key. There was a huge king jumping and busting on some smaller Spanish about 200 yards away from the boat. We quickly turned our boat and trolled two live 18inch ladyfish over the spot where we spotted the king. Sure enough, it exploded on our ladyfish and the rest is history–he was a winner.
My Warriors Place Tournament: This is a species tournament. One of each species of fish can be entered into this tournament–if it swims, it counts; but, they all must be caught on hook and line.
In this tournament we like to have a bunch of different baits. To catch most baitfish we like to use Sabiki rigs and for sheepshead and black drum we like to use black sea crabs. To catch snook, redfish, jacks, grouper, cobia and trout, we like to specifically use greenbacks. For snapper, grunts, flounder, bonnethead sharks and seabass, we like to use shrimp. To catch Spanish mackerel, bluefish, ladyfish and bonita, we like to use gold spoons. For blacktips, bull sharks, hammerheads, lemon sharks, Atlantic sharpnose sharks and nurse sharks we like to use ladyfish chunks. To catch permit and pompano, we like to use Silly Willie jigs. We also catch other bi-product fish such as catfish, needlefish, stingrays, cowfish and mother in law fish. Most species tournaments are won with a dozen different species or more, and are usually an all-release tournament.
Grand Slam Tournaments: Grand Slam tournaments usually consist of snook, redfish and trout. The largest of each fish is measured and the winner of the Grand Slam is the angler with the largest of all three species combined.
To catch the biggest snook in spring we spot a pod of snook and cast a fresh cut ladyfish head into them. For large redfish, we like to fish on the ledge of were the edge of the flat meets the edge of the deeper water. We target them using a big live pinfish hooked in the back with its tail cut off, and an egg sinker a foot up from the hook. For gator trout, we like to use a large live threadfins under a bobber hooked in the nose. All Grand Slam tournaments and most other tournaments are catch and release photo/ruler tournaments. Most Grand Slam tournaments are won with 70 total inches or more. The best tournament slam I’ve ever seen was just over 100 inches total.
Whether you’re in a tournament or just out on a day of fishing, spring is one of the best times of the year. It’s all about understanding the food chain and targeting gamefish with what they want to eat in the right place at the right time.

No. 6 Xavier escaped with a narrow victory Tuesday at St. John's, which is winless in the Big East, but the Musketeers are not fretting the 73-68 outcome as they prepare to host Georgetown on Saturday.
The win over St. John's was Xavier's first game in six days, and the Red Storm took the Musketeers (20-3, 8-2 Big East) to the limit in Cincinnati only 13 days previously, losing 88-82.
Xavier coach Chris Mack is looking mostly at how defensive stops down the stretch led to the victory. St. John's, 0-11 in conference play, was thrwarted three consecutive times from scoring in the last minute.
"We didn't play particularly well, but I thought St. John's had a lot to do with that," Mack said. "They hit you with quickness on both ends of the floor. ... We knew it would be a tough game. We didn't have any kind of mindset -- at least the coaching staff didn't -- we didn't have any inkling it wasn't going to be a tough game."
The Musketeers committed 16 turnovers against St. John's, but their balanced scoring proved to be the difference.
Xavier had four players in double figures, led by Trevon Blueitt's 14 points. Kerem Kanter, who hit a pivotal 3-pointer with 18 seconds left, finished with 13 points. Quentin Goodin (13) and J.P. Macura (11) were the other double-figure scorers.
Kaiser Gates scored all five of his points in the last eight minutes. Freshman Naji Marshall added seven points.
"It didn't look good, but if we can go on the road and win, it's always good enough," Goodin said.
Georgetown (13-8, 3-7) has lost four of its last five games. The game at Xavier is the second of three straight road games for the Hoyas, who play at Providence on Tuesday. They are 3-3 on the road.
Freshman guard Jahvon Blair had a career-high 21 points, bolstered by five 3-pointers and a perfect 4-of-4 performance from the free throw line, in Georgetown's 85-77 loss at Creighton on Tuesday.

SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Franchy Cordero and Hunter Renfroe, teammates in the Pacific Coast League last season, combined to drive in all of the San Diego Padres' runs in a 4-2, sweep-clinching victory over the Cincinnati Reds on Wednesday.
Renfroe hit his 14th home run, a two-run shot that tied the score 2-2 in the sixth inning, and Cordero hit a tie-breaking single in the seventh before Renfroe's RBI groundout finished the surge.
''I know exactly what Franchy's all about, and he's done everything I expected of him since he came up,'' Renfroe said of his fellow rookie.
Padres starter Jhoulys Chacin (6-5) pitched seven innings, allowing five hits and two runs.
Reds reliever Michael Lorenzen (3-2) inherited a 2-2 score from starter Amir Garrett and began the seventh with two walks, leading to two runs.
The Reds, who have lost their past nine road games, were swept at both Dodger Stadium and Petco Park to go 0-6 on the West Coast trip.
The left-handed hitting Cordero hit three home runs over the first two games of the series.
He had two singles in the finale. The second, a groundball to right field, scored Matt Szczur, who had drawn a leadoff walk against Lorenzen as a pinch-hitter.
The RBI single came after Cordero mistakenly attempted to bunt, causing third-base coach Glenn Hoffman to tell him to swing away.
''We made sure that he got the message that we trusted his bat,'' manager Andy Green said.
Green said Cordero, who made his major league debut May 27 as a replacement for injured center fielder Manuel Margot, was ''being selfless'' when he tried to bunt, but the smarter play was to swing because Lorenzen is a strikeout pitcher.
Green said the advice to Renfroe was to be patient.
''Hunter Renfroe does not need to cheat to get to any pitch,'' Green said.
Renfroe hit Garrett's 88 mph fastball 429 feet into the top of the second deck to score Yangervis Solarte and tie Nate Colbert for the most home runs by a Padres rookie before the All-Star break. Colbert went on to hit 24 home runs in that expansion season, 1969.
Brandon Mauer recorded his 12th save in 14 tries after Brad Hand threw a scoreless eighth.
The Reds rediscovered their home run prowess, getting solo shots from Jose Peraza and Joey Votto after not adding to the team's majors-leading home run total in the series' first and second games.
Peraza hit Chacin's second pitch of the game into the left-field seats for the team's first leadoff homer of the season. For Peraza, it was his third home run.
Votto cleared the wall in right-center field for his 19th homer.
Garrett took a 2-0 lead into the sixth before Solarte singled and Renfroe blasted the lefty's 91st pitch of the afternoon.
The lefty starter, 25, brought in an ERA of 7.40.
''This was a great step,'' Reds manager Bryan Price said. ''He's a great kid, he's a great worker, everybody pulls for Amir to do well, and I think that was certainly a step in the right direction because he was throwing three pitches over the plate for strikes and he was on the attack.''
HIGHLIGHT DEFENSE
Prompting applause from Garrett, three Reds defenders teamed up to nab Erick Aybar trying to score from first on Luis Torrens' second-inning double.
Center fielder Arismendy Alcantara threw to second baseman Scooter Gennett, who threw to catcher Tucker Barnhart. Video review upheld the out call of plate umpire Ted Barrett.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Reds: Zack Cosart, who went into Wednesday as the leading vote-getter at shortstop for the All-Star Game, was out of the starting lineup with a quad injury for the second day in a row. He was pulled from Monday's lopsided game due to the quad.
Padres: RHP Trevor Cahill is expected to throw bullpen sessions on the upcoming trip and then begin a minor league assignment.
UP NEXT
Reds: RHP Tim Adelman (4-2, 4.34) on Friday will face the Los Angeles Dodgers in Cincinnati after going 2-0 with 2.08 ERA in his past four starts.
Padres: RHP Miguel Diaz, who made 21 relief appearance this year, will make his second career start Friday against the Milwaukee Brewers in San Diego. In his first start, last Saturday against the Kansas City Royals, the rookie was unable to get an out in the third inning.
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The killing of the North Korean leader's outcast half brother adds to a long list of high-profile assassinations or attempts in which the country is suspected of targeting estranged relatives of the Kim clan, turncoats and South Korean public figures.
King Jong Nam told medical workers he had been attacked with chemical spray at the Kuala Lumpur airport before he died, Malaysian officials have said. Leader Kim Jong Un has executed or purged a slew of high-level government officials since taking power in late 2011, and experts believe he might have been trying to eliminate a potential challenger to his leadership. Others think he was enraged over recent news reports that his brother tried to defect to the South in 2012.
North Korea has denied carrying out some of the killings and not commented on others. Some of the most notable assassinations or attempts it is suspected of doing:
TRAITOR COUSIN
Lee Han-young, a nephew of one of the former wives of the country's second leader Kim Jong Il, was found dead of gunshot wounds in front of a Seoul apartment in 1997. Lee had defected to South Korea through Switzerland in 1982, but Seoul kept his arrival secret until 1996, when his mother also fled the North. Lee had harshly criticized the country and his dictator uncle. The investigation into his death concluded Lee was killed by North Korean agents sent to deliver Pyongyang's payback and the assailants returned to North Korea before they could be captured.
BLAST IN YANGON
North Korean agents set off a bomb meant for South Korea's leader while he was visiting Burma in 1983. President Chun Doo-hwan narrowly escaped the attack, but more than 20 people were killed, including four of his Cabinet ministers, his ambassador to Yangon and several top aides. One North Korean agent was shot to death by police, a second was hanged in jail and a third reportedly died in prison in 2008. Burma, now known as Myanmar, cut diplomatic ties with North Korea following the blast, but they restored relations in 2007.
SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT
A team of 31 North Korean commandos slipped undetected into South Korea in 1968 and came within striking distance of the Seoul presidential palace. South Korean security forces managed to repel the assault at the last minute. The only commando that was captured said he had come to "slit the throat of (then-President) Park Chung-hee."
A furious Park established a secret commando team tasked with demolishing the Pyongyang palace of North Korea's founder. Tensions later eased, but the South Korean commando team, incensed that the planned infiltration was aborted, mutinied in 1971, killing their trainers and marching on Seoul before being stopped.
HIGH-PROFILE DEFECTOR
In 2010, two agents posing as defectors were arrested in a plot to assassinate Hwang Jang-yop, a former Workers' Party secretary who remains the highest-level North Korean to seek asylum in the South. South Korean officials said both agents were majors in North Korea's main army intelligence agency and were under orders to slit Hwang's throat. Hwang, who once tutored Kim Jong Il, bitterly criticized the North Korean government after his 1997 defection. North Korea called him a traitor and "human scum." He died six months after the assassination attempt at the age of 87.
An source close to Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas has told Yisrael Hayom that Abu-Mazen is considering declaring Gaza a "rebel province".
The move, defined by the Palestinian official as the "doomsday weapon" in Abbas's struggle against Hamas, was intended mainly to exert pressure on Hamas to transfer the authority of the government in Gaza to the PA government.

SAN DIEGO (AP) — A former U.S. Navy commander has pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy in the latest fallout from a corruption case that spanned a decade and involved dozens of Navy officials.
Federal prosecutors say Troy Amundson entered pleas Tuesday in San Diego. The Ramsey, Minnesota native could face up to five years in prison.
Amundsen was responsible for coordinating the Navy's joint military exercises with foreign counterparts.
He acknowledged that from 2005 to 2013, he accepted bribes in the form of prostitutes and entertainment expenses in exchange for helping a Malaysian businessman nicknamed "Fat Leonard" Francis.
Authorities say Francis bribed officials to help him overbill the Navy for fuel, food and other services his company provided to ships docked in Asian ports.
Twenty people have pleaded guilty so far.
FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — The Latest on sexual assault allegations against Kentucky GOP state Rep. Dan Johnson (all times local):
4:15 p.m.
The Republican leadership of the Kentucky House of Representatives says a GOP lawmaker should resign after a woman accused him of sexually assaulting her in 2013.
A news release from the four GOP House leaders on Monday called a report released earlier in the day by the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting "compelling and deeply troubling." The report quotes Maranda Richmond as saying that Dan Johnson assaulted her in the basement of his house in the early morning hours of Jan. 1, 2013.
Johnson did not respond to a telephone message seeking comment Monday.
The leaders of the state Republican and Democratic parties have also called for Johnson to resign. Republican Gov. Matt Bevin said he has not seen the report and wanted to wait "until we get some facts" before commenting.
The Associated Press does not generally identify alleged sexual assault victims, but is doing so because Richmond has gone public.

2:10 p.m.
A Kentucky lawmaker who attracted national attention last year when he compared President Barack Obama and his wife to monkeys has been accused of sexual assault.
The Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting quotes Maranda Richmond as saying she has asked Louisville police to reopen an investigation of Dan Johnson.
Johnson was elected to the state legislature in 2016 — after he posted the Facebook remarks about the Obamas. He didn't respond to a voicemail Monday. Richmond says Johnson assaulted her in 2012. She says she reported it to police in 2013, but the case was closed without charges. No one at the police department responded to a telephone call seeking comment.

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Two major U.S. and Mexican labor federations said they have filed a complaint under the North American Free Trade Agreement against Mexican laws that allow companies to sign contracts with employer-friendly unions before they even open a plant in the country.
The complaint by the AFL-CIO and Mexico's UNT was filed Thursday with the U.S. National Administrative Office of the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation, known as NAALC. The office was created under the NAFTA sidebar agreements, but has been criticized as having little power.
"The heart of the problem is the 'protection contract'... signed between an employer and an employer-dominated union without the involvement or even the knowledge of the workers," according to the complaint. "In some cases, contracts are signed even before a company hires its first worker."
Mexican autoworkers have protested against contracts signed by automakers like BMW and Audi years before they opened plants here, which allow the companies to pay workers as little as $1.40 per hour.
In the case of Audi, the company apparently hired around 20 people, including pro-company union leaders, who signed a contract in 2014 specifying low wages. When the plant opened in 2016, the over 5,000 workers eventually hired had no say on the contract or their leaders.
The complaint says the pro-company contracts were the reason that "the enormous wage disparity between Mexico and the United States has not changed during the 24 years since NAFTA was ratified."
While Mexico has in theory passed a reform law requiring secret-ballot votes in union elections, the ruling party has proposed secondary legislation that would basically erase that requirement, and allow pro-company, pro-government unions undue power in certifying union representation.

But while the bill awaits Gov. Bill Haslam’s signature, its stated goal of halting emissions testing on cars and trucks won’t happen overnight.
In fact, it could take three or more years to develop alternatives to the testing program, used to lower air pollution, and also take them to federal regulators and win approval there, according to a Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation official.
Final say-so will have to come from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which calls the shots on federal Clean Air Act requirements and the steps needed to cut air pollution levels and ensure continued compliance with air quality standards.
“The bill ends the inspection and maintenance [emissions testing] program in Tennessee if EPA approves,” said Kim Schofinski, a spokeswoman with TDEC, in an email response to Times Free Press inquiries.
She noted TDEC still continues to work on submitting another plan to EPA, based on a 2016 law passed by state lawmakers that sought to exempt new vehicles from the emissions testing.
“TDEC will broaden the scope of its current analysis regarding the impact of legislation enacted by the General Assembly previously to exempt three years or newer motor vehicles on air quality,” Schofinski said. “We anticipate that this analysis should take six months to a year. The steps to be taken after that will be determined by the results of the analysis.”
The “total process to obtain EPA approval could take three years or more depending on many variables, including the speed of federal action,” Schofinski added. “Substitute measures will need to be taken if the analysis demonstrates that the elimination of emissions testing will interfere with air quality.”
Two Hamilton County lawmakers who are leading the charge to end vehicle emissions testing said they remain confident DEC and local officials will be able to develop less intrusive alternatives to vehicle testing if that step becomes necessary.
Sen. Bo Watson, R-Hixson, and Rep. Mike Carter, R-Ooltewah, said they believe Hamilton, Davidson, Rutherford, Sumner, Williamson and Wilson counties can follow paths blazed by Shelby County to get out of its emissions testing program. Knox County avoided it entirely by restricting truck speeds in a broad area.
Still, Watson said, “I don’t want to mislead the public. You know, it doesn’t happen immediately. There are some contractual things that have to be worked out. I mean, 2019 would be the first time it could actually be repealed or eliminated.”
Moreover, Watson added, “full disclosure and transparency: That’s contingent on TDEC working with locals working with EPA to come up with a replacement program. So that’s why I’ve said this is a repeal and replace [bill]. We’re repealing [testing], but we got to be able to replace it with something. We’ve understood that all along.”
Watson and Carter filed the bill this year after TDEC officials announced last summer that all of Tennessee’s 95 counties are now fully compliant, or in EPA jargon in “100 percent attainment,” on federal ambient air quality requirements for ozone and particulate matter.
Hamilton, Davidson, Rutherford, Sumner, Williamson and Wilson counties all have EPA-approved vehicle emissions testing programs they have used to lower emissions as the state sought to meet federal Clean Air Act provisions mandating safer air quality.
Hamilton County officials initiated the testing program in 2005 to ensure pollution wouldn’t be a problem as the community sought to develop the county’s Enterprise South industrial park and lure a major manufacturer to the site. In 2007, Volkswagen located its lone U.S. auto assembly plant there.
Local officials, as well as TDEC Commissioner Bob Martineau, raised concerns about the bill initially.
“I think they are to the point they understand we have to look at some other options to replace it,” Watson said. “And obviously, we’re going to ask them to look at options that are the least intrusive, the least objectionable that we can find.”
He noted “we’ve done a great job in Hamilton County, obviously, in cleaning up our environment. And no one wants to change that.”
It’s not immediately clear what impact the Tennessee Valley Authority’s move to shut down three of its coal-fired power generating plants in Tennessee and Alabama since 2005 will have. The plants were major polluters.
Watson said that of all the issues he’s dealt with since being elected in the early 2000s, “I would argue that I get more emails and phone calls and letters about this issue than anything. And it’s usually from people saying, ‘I can’t get my car to pass and I don’t have $600 to fix it.’”
“Our argument is this kind of hurts people who can least afford it,” he added.
Seniors and others have complained to the Times Free Press that addressing a check-engine light issue, an automatic failure in the programs, can cost hundreds of dollars, sometimes more. And many dislike testing center lines, as well as the $9 fee.
Hamilton County Clerk Bill Knowles’ office issues license tags for vehicles that the state said must pass emissions tests before a tag can bought or renewed.
On the office’s website, Knowles has posted a notice in response to many inquiries he’s gotten about the legislation.
“Emission testing remains in effect prior to titling or renewing a vehicle registration until repeal is approved by the United States Environment Protection Agency,” the notice said. “When approval is granted Hamilton County government will be notified. Updates will be posted as they become available.”
Knowles said in an interview his office is required under state law to ensure vehicle owners have the required proof of passing emissions testing before issuing tags.
Over the years, Knowles said, he’s heard heartbreaking stories from people who “tell me they can’t afford to fix their vehicle.” While sympathetic, he said, “I have nothing to do with it. It’s an air pollution program.”
He said he posted the website caution to visitors who are calling to see if they still need to have their vehicles tested now.
The initiative co-sponsored by members of the Wilson County legislative delegation, state Rep. Susan Lynn, R-Mt. Juliet, and state Rep. Clark Boyd, R-Lebanon, requiring counties to take all necessary steps to end mandatory vehicle emissions testing in Tennessee passed in the House chamber last week.
The bill was approved by a 96-0 vote tally by House members and would apply to residents of Wilson County where emissions testing is still required prior to vehicle registration or renewal.
The 1990 Federal Clean Air Act required the state to develop more restrictive regulations to control air pollution from mobile sources in counties, which were not meeting the Federal Standards for air quality.
Currently, testing is done on vehicles with a model year of 1975 and newer if they are powered by a gasoline or diesel engine and weigh up to 10,500 pounds. More than 1.5 million vehicles went through emissions testing in Tennessee last year in the six counties where it is required.
“Vehicle emissions testing is a process that creates avoidable stress and financial burdens for our working families,” said Lynn. “House Bill 1782 moves Tennessee away from mandatory vehicle emissions testing which benefits our citizens and doesn’t create any harmful environmental side effects.”
The idea for House Bill 1782 came following a report from the Tennessee Department of Environment & Conservation released in August that showed all 95 Tennessee counties met federal air quality health standards.
“Vehicle testing is not only time consuming but seems to disproportionally affect people who can least afford to make repairs to their cars.” said Boyd. “The people of Wilson County have been loud and clear in their support of this legislation to end emissions testing. I have heard them and am proud to be a sponsor of this legislation.”
The bill would require the state to end a state testing contract for Hamilton, Rutherford, Sumner, Williamson and Wilson counties in 2019 unless the EPA has not acted.
Davidson County has its own contract, which expires in 2021, Watson recalled.
The bill would do away with the $9 testing fee, most of which now goes to the state to pay for the five-county emissions testing contract. But in order to avoid getting slapped with an expenses analysis that might have made the bill harder to pass, it includes a provision allowing county commissions vote to keep a $4 fee on title and tag issuance. Of that, $3 would go into the county’s general fund and $1 to county clerks.

While some states in the Northeast want to close their borders with Bangaldesh and Myanmar, Mizoram took a different approach on Monday during a meeting of Northeast Chief Ministers on security along the Indo-Myanmar border which was chaired by Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh.
And on the border along with Bangladesh, the Mizoram chief minister said that border fencing has led to lost of land, reports zoramobserver.com.
"Border fencing along, both with Myanmar and Bangladesh, has forced our people from farming outside the fencing areas. As such we are losing precious land.
In addition, our boundaries with Myanmar and Bangladesh are divided by natural rivers which makes fencing not only difficult, but not good for our farmers," he said.
Mizoram Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla, citing close ethnic ties with people on the Myanmar side of the border, said that the present free zone should be extended from 16 km to 60 km and that the duration of stay in both countries should be made 60 days as against the current 72 hours deadline.
"For us in Mizoram, due to our ethnic ties with the people on the other side of Myanmar border, we would welcome restoration of a 60-km free zone and a stay period of up to 60 days as against 72 hours," Lal Thanhawla said during the meeting.
India and Myanmar has a free movement agreement that allows people from either side of the international border to enter the country up to a certain limit and period. Mizoram stand is opposed to Arunachal Pradesh which wants its sections of the border with Myanmar to be sealed.
Lal Thanhawla also urged the Central government to make useful of the traditional ties of the Zo people.
"India can exploit this traditional and cultural ties to promote trade and business opportunities as part of its Act East Policy," he said.
The chief minister also said that Mizoram will soon come up with guidelines on a Free Movement Regime. So far, the state has four designated crossing points where entry fees are collected from visitors. [Read More]

LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (CBSNewYork) — Giancarlo Stanton said he put the Yankees on his trade wish list after admiring them from afar.
“Seeing their young, dynamic group, the way they flow together on the field, how they never give up, never quit, the atmosphere, there’s the storied franchise,” the slugger said at his introductory news conference Monday at baseball’s winter meeting. “There’s not much you can say about why you wouldn’t want to be there.”
The Yankees acquired the reigning National League MVP from the Miami Marlins for second baseman Starlin Castro and pitching prospects Jorge Guzman and Jose Devers. Stanton had a no-trade clause in his megacontract, meaning he had a say-so in where he was dealt.
He said he met with the Marlins and told them he was not interested in being part of new CEO Derek Jeter’s rebuild. Miami had reached deals with the Giants and Cardinals, but Stanton rejected them.

“I’m glad to be here and part of the New York Yankees,” said Stanton, who batted .281 with 59 homers last season. “This is going to be a great new chapter in my life and my career.
“This has been quite the experience, quite the road to get here. When I signed up in Miami, I wanted things to work out, and I had a good vision there. But sometimes things just spiral out of place and you have to find a new home.”
In New York, Stanton will team up with Aaron Judge, the only other major league player since 2013 to hit more than 50 homers in a season.
“We’re excited to get better together and use our talents together, because we’re very similar, and we’re going to learn from each other and make each other better,” Stanton said of Judge.

General manager Brian Cashman said the trade puts the Yankees one step closer to winning a world championship. They fell one win short of reaching the World Series last season.
“These are exciting times,” he said. “Every day our baseball operations department, under the guidance of the Steinbrenner family, are trying to find ways to improve the club. Sometimes they’re in big ways; sometimes they’re in small ways.
“That’s part of our job is to find pieces that can help us take further steps, pieces that can play a role in the future efforts to try to find a way to be that last team standing.”
New manager Aaron Boone said he believes Stanton will mesh well with the rest of the Yankees.
“As much as we are excited to have the National League MVP join our lineup and all that goes with that and all the expectations we have for him to come in and play so well at Yankee Stadium, we have a group of young men that we’re so excited about what they bring from a character standpoint in that room,” he said. “We feel like we really have a special culture brewing, and we feel like adding Giancarlo — yes, the player, but just as much the person — to that room, he’s only going to make it even stronger.”

LEXINGTON, S.C. (AP) — A Baptist church in South Carolina has voted to remove a statue of Jesus Christ because some believe it's too "Catholic" for their place of worship.
The hand-carved, 7-foot (2-meter) statue and accompanying reliefs showing scenes from the life of Christ have been displayed outside Red Bank Baptist Church in Lexington for a decade.
But Pastor Jeff Wright says the statue is being taken down this week. In a letter, Pastor said some congregants feel it is "Catholic in nature," and it needs to be removed to avoid confusion. He did not explain why. Wright didn't return telephone calls or respond to messages The Associated Press left in person with his staff Wednesday.
Artist Delbert Baker Jr. responded in a letter posted on Facebook that removing the statue makes no sense.

The lead character of Sebastian Lelio's film "A Fantastic Woman " is named Marina. She is a nightclub singer and a waitress. She has a boyfriend, Orlando, who is much older than her, but that matters little. They are clearly smitten with one another and in that post-honeymoon phase of the relationship where things are still passionate, but also calm and comforting. They're planning a trip together. She's moving in. Life is moving along nicely it seems.
Marina is also a transgender woman, portrayed by a transgender actress, Daniela Vega. If you've heard of "A Fantastic Woman," which recently picked up a best foreign language film nomination for Chile, you've likely heard this fact. It might even be the only thing you know about it.
What's astonishing about the actual experience of watching "A Fantastic Woman" is how small of "a thing" it really is, and in that way perhaps one of the truest expressions of modern transgender life that we've ever seen in a fictional film. Marina is just Marina. She has a delicate beauty, and a cool choppy Alexa Chung-like haircut and style. On stage, she's performs with a sultry confidence. Off stage, she's quieter and almost reserved, but very present, especially around Orlando (Francisco Reyes).
But one night, Orlando dies suddenly and Marina's tranquility is thrown into a tailspin — not just from the death of her love, but from all the unnecessary and often ridiculous complications, some bureaucratic, some purely emotional, that emerge and seem to stem from the fact that she is transgender.
At the hospital where Orlando dies, the fact that her legal name is still her birth name and not Marina becomes an issue with a cop (who an uncomfortable doctor calls when she leaves the scene after he's pronounced dead). A social worker, too, becomes obsessed with checking on Marina, which she continues to explain is just a matter of procedure and to ensure that she was not abused or a sex worker, but which feels nothing but invasive and inappropriate from Marina's perspective. Orlando's family, too, is unconscionably cruel to her — save for his brother, Gabo (Luis Gnecco), who seems to be the only person in the film empathetic to the fact that Marina is just a human who has lost a loved one.
Every day is filled with the ever-present threat that someone is going to be uncomfortable with her. Marina is gracious and accommodating almost to a fault, both to the insidiously subtle kinds of judgment and the more outward violence and hatred. Orlando's ex-wife tells her in no uncertain terms that she is not welcome at the funeral or wake. His grief stricken son is disgusted by her and makes no attempt to hide. And all Marina wants to do is grieve in her own way.
Lelio's film occasionally delves into some magical realism as Marina struggles to maintain her composure amid such callous inhumanity from so many people, which is a beautiful if jarring disruption in a film that's otherwise so committed to reality.
It's Vega's extraordinary performance, full of grace and depth, that keeps "A Fantastic Woman" in check from becoming something either too campy or too sanctimonious. It's one that has the power to make an audience really understand and internalize why it is an act of bravery to simply live life as herself, and perhaps even change some minds in the process.
"A Fantastic Woman," a Sony Pictures Classics release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for "language, sexual content, nudity and a disturbing assault." Running time: 104 minutes. Three stars out of four.

LINDEN, N.J. (CBSNewYork) – Union County hazmat crews are responding to a gasoline spill in Linden, New Jersey.
Around 8:30 a.m. Wednesday, a tractor-trailer driving on S. Stiles Street attempted to make a left turn onto Route 1 and overturned. Its tanker ruptured, spilling 9,000 gallons of gasoline onto the roadway.
The driver was treated on the scene for minor injuries.

Route 1 is closed in both directions between Pleasant Street and Wood Avenue.
Police expect cleanup efforts to last well past rush-hour and into Thursday morning. Drivers should avoid the area.
The Crown Inn on Route 1 has been evacuated and Wheeler Park is closed to pedestrian traffic. Members of the Linden Fire Department are going door-to-door to measure air quality levels.
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve's latest survey of business conditions found manufacturing activity accelerating in many parts of the country in late April and early May, even as some businesses expressed concern about uncertainty cause by rising trade tensions.
The Fed said Wednesday that its survey described the economy as expanding at a moderate pace with more than half of the central bank's 12 regions reporting a pickup in industrial activity and a third of those districts describing manufacturing conditions as "strong."
The survey was taken after the Trump administration announced plans to institute tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum, actions designed to boost domestic producers.
It will inform discussions when the central bank meets next month, when it is expected to raise rates.
The Syrian government has recognized Abkhazia and South Ossetia, two Georgian breakaway regions backed by Russia, as independent countries.
"A deal has been reached between the Syrian Arab Republic, the Republic of Abkhazia and the Republic of South Ossetia to exchange recognition and set up diplomatic ties at the embassy level," said a Syrian Foreign Ministry official in comments circulated by the state-run SANA news agency on Tuesday.

The move prompted the Georgian government to announce its decision to sever official ties with Syria, blaming Russia for orchestrating the diplomatic stunt.
"With this act, the Assad regime declared its support for Russia's military aggression against Georgia, the illegal occupation of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali [South Ossetia] regions and the ethnic cleansing that has been taking place for years," said a statement from the Georgian Foreign Ministry.
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Abkhazia and South Ossetia were internationally recognized as part of Georgia. But in 2008, Russia waged war over the regions, deploying thousands of troops and recognizing them as independent states.
Politics of recognition
After the brief war, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Nauru recognized both regions as independent of Georgia. Although Syria has maintained close ties with Russia for decades, Moscow's involvement in the country's conflict in recent years has strengthened their bond.

Abkhazia and South Ossetia have historically been autonomous regions of Georgia, even during the Soviet Union. In the wake of the Cold War, separatists fought a war against Georgian forces, a conflict that displaced 250,000 people and killed more than 12,000 others.
Both the US and EU have refused to recognize the breakaway regions, saying they form part of Georgia's territorial integrity.

PITTSBURGH (AP) — Evgeni Malkin got his 12th career hat trick and Bryan Rust scored two goals as the surging Pittsburgh Penguins rallied for a 5-2 victory over the San Jose Sharks on Tuesday night.
Malkin's 24th goal of the season late in the second period tied it. His 25th early in the third gave Pittsburgh the lead for good and his 26th rolled into an empty net with just more than a minute remaining as the Penguins won for the eighth time in 10 games.
Matt Murray stopped 40 shots in his first start since the death of his father, James, this month.
Brent Burns and Logan Couture scored power-play goals for the Sharks but San Jose dropped its second straight game without Joe Thornton, who is out indefinitely with a right leg injury.
Martin Jones finished with 26 saves but also gave the puck away behind the San Jose net in the third period. Patric Hornqvist intercepted Jones' sloppy clearing attempt and fed it in front to a streaking Malkin, who had little trouble putting it into an open net 6:01 into the third.
Rust, hindered by injuries this season, doubled Pittsburgh's advantage 13:58 into the third thanks to a pretty between-the-legs drop pass from Tom Kuhnhackl before Malkin finished off Pittsburgh's sixth straight home victory.
The Penguins returned from the All-Star break looking to build off their best extended play of the season, which has lifted the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions out of a funk and back into the thick of the packed Metropolitan Division race.
It's a surge they've made largely without Murray, who took a leave of absence after his father died on Jan. 16. Casey DeSmith and Tristian Jarry filled in capably with Murray out, but the 23-year-old let coach Mike Sullivan know he was ready to go as his team began what it hopes is a push toward another long playoff run.
Murray certainly looked sharp in his first start since shutting out Boston on Jan. 7, keeping the Penguins in it as San Jose dominated play for long stretches.
Rust's first goal since Nov. 27 on a slick backhand that slid by Jones gave Pittsburgh the lead 11:09 into the first, but the Sharks used a pair of power-play goals in the second to surge ahead. Burns slipped a wrist shot from the point through traffic to tie it at the game's midway point and Couture pounded home a rebound 18:35 into the second to put San Jose in front.
With time winding down in the second, Phil Kessel went to the corner and fed a blind backhand pass to Malkin, who ripped it by Jones with just four seconds left to even the score and give the Penguins a serious boost.
NOTES: Penguins captain Sidney Crosby got an assist on Malkin's empty-netter to extend his point streak to 10 games. ... Malkin played in his 754th career game, passing Jean Provonost for fourth-most in franchise history. ... The Sharks scratched forward Jannik Hansen, C Daniel O'Regan and D Tim Heed. The Penguins scratched D Chad Ruhwedel, D Matt Hunwick and forward Ryan Reaves. ... Pittsburgh went 0 for 3 on the power play. The Sharks were 2 for 5 with the man advantage.

Sharks: Continue their five-game road trip Wednesday in Detroit.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Netflix is on the verge of surpassing 100 million global subscribers, a testament to how much the video streaming service has changed the entertainment landscape since its debut a decade ago.
The company will reach that milestone this weekend if its projections are correct. Netflix made the prediction Monday with the release of its first-quarter earnings.
The service added nearly 5 million subscribers during the first three months of the year, and will end March with 98.7 million customers in roughly 190 countries.
THANK THE SMARTPHONE
Over the past decade, “what really did it for Netflix was the explosion of phones and tablets that allowed people to watch video everywhere,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter. “But Netflix clearly had a vision before those devices became so ubiquitous.”
About 51 million of Netflix’s subscribers are in the U.S. By the end of this year, Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson expects the majority of the company’s subscribers to be overseas. Netflix ended March with nearly 48 million subscribers outside the U.S.
Netflix CEO Reed Hastings expects the next 100 million subscribers to come more quickly than the first 100 million, but he didn’t provide a specific timetable during online video review of the company’s first quarter.
“Everybody watches TV and nearly everybody has the internet, so I don’t see anything that’s going to stop Netflix from getting to most people in the United States and then eventually hopefully most people around the world,” Hastings said.
Progress toward that ambitious goal has helped drive the company’s stock price progressively higher over the past five years. In that time, Netflix has added 72 million more subscribers.
The Los Gatos, California company currently has a market value of about $63 billion. Its stock rose $1.90 to $149.15 in Monday’s extended trading, even though subscriber growth during the first quarter came in slightly below management forecasts.
STILL CHASING HBO
For all its success, Netflix still has a ways to go before it catches up with HBO, the popular pay-TV channel that has served as its role model. HBO has 134 million subscribers worldwide, including viewers paying for an internet-only version of the channel that was inspired by Netflix’s success.
Other cable channels also are offering internet-only options as more viewers, especially younger people, eschew traditional TV packages and subscribe to streaming services instead.
The trend has confronted Netflix with more competition in the battle for household entertainment budgets. Netflix so far has answered the challenge by spending heavily on original shows such as “Stranger Things” and “House of Cards” and selling its service at a relatively low price. Netflix’s subscriptions range from $8 to $12 per month, with the most popular option at $10.
“The model works from a consumer perspective because it is such a good value,” Pachter said.
In a measure of how much Netflix subscribers like the service, Hastings said Monday that they collectively stream more than 1 billion hours of programming per week.
By comparison, Google says about 1 billion hours of video per day are watched on its mostly free YouTube service. “We have YouTube envy,” Hastings joked.
WILL NETFLIX RAISE PRICES?
Pachter and other analysts wonder how long Netflix will be able to hold the line on price as its programming costs rise in tandem with its appeal to a more diverse international audience. Movie and TV studios typically also demand more money as more people subscribe to channels to in an effort to make as much as possible off their content.
As it is, Netflix expects to spend about $6 billion on programming this year.
Netflix hasn’t given any inkling it will raise prices again. It lost some long-time U.S. subscribers after their rates went up by as much as $2 per month last year. Netflix had previously frozen prices for millions of subscribers at 2014 levels.
But if it wants to keep investors happy, the company will eventually have to improve its relatively low profit margin. The Los Gatos, California, company earned $178 million on revenue of $2.6 billion in the first quarter. Analysts predict Netflix will make $482 million on revenue of more than $11 billion for the entire year.
WASHINGTON (AP) — The top commander of U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan says some Taliban fighters and leaders are talking to the Afghan government about peace prospects.
Gen. John Nicholson told reporters at the Pentagon on Wednesday that he could not be more specific about this because the talks are confidential. He said they involve mid-level as well as high-level Taliban figures in exploratory contacts that are taking place "off stage," even as fighting continues.
In what he suggested was evidence of interest in a peace process, Nicholson said the Taliban's spring offensive, announced in late April, has been less intense than in recent years. He also argued that Afghan government forces are demonstrating an improved ability to defeat Taliban attacks.
'America has no greater friend than Israel, and Israel has no greater friend than America.'
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu wished the United States a happy Independence Day in a video message posted on social media.
"Congratulations, America, on the Fourth of July," Netanyahu said.
"On that day 242 years ago, a great birth of freedom occurred. And it wasn't just freedom for the United States of America. It was freedom for the world.
"What a difference America has made in standing up for liberty, standing up for democracy, and standing up for decency.
"America has our greatest admiration.
"America has no greater friend than Israel, and Israel has no greater friend than America."
Nokia has announced it will re-launch the world’s most loved mobile phone - the Nokia 3310!
The Nokia 3310 was first launched in 2000 and some people are still using them.
To date, 126 millions Nokia 3310 phones have been sold.
The 3310 won cult status because of its near indestructible durability. It also featured much loved games such as ‘Snake II’ and ‘Space Impact’.
The new incarnation of the phone will be sold for just €59 and will be launched at the Mobile World Congress later this month.
The battery life on the new 3310 is expected to much greater than the power used to operate modern day smart phones.
MIAMI (AP) — School district officials in Florida said they followed standard protocol last week when a 7-year-old boy was placed in handcuffs and removed from his school — and they say it was the second time since the school year began that the first-grader had to be restrained following aggressive behavior.
The latest episode occurred Thursday, when a teacher at the Coral Way K-8 Center in Miami told the boy to stop playing with his food in the cafeteria. When the child refused to stop, he was taken from the cafeteria, according to an incident report from Miami-Dade County Public Schools police officer Munick Soriano.
The report said the boy hit the teacher repeatedly in the back when they were in a hallway outside the cafeteria. The child continued punching and kicking the teacher until they both fell on the ground, according to the report, which also said he grabbed her hair.
The boy was hospitalized briefly at Miami Children's Hospital under the Florida Mental Health Act, based on behavioral criteria that indicated he could pose a threat to himself or others, school district officials said. Authorities later said it was the second time officers had resorted to handcuffing the student under the same law.
The child's mother, Mercy Alvarez, said her son doesn't have a mental disorder. Instead, she called what happened to her son "police abuse."
"If my child wasn't aggressive anymore when we got there, like they were saying he was before, why take such extreme measures?" she said.
Alvarez said her child didn't show aggressive behavior at home until the school year started; she said in past years he had gotten good grades, participated in other activities and behaved well.
"This is too much for a boy that age to go through. It can't be a normal procedure," she said.
Alvarez recorded the incident last week with her cellphone and shared it on Facebook, where it has been viewed nearly 3 million times.
In his report, Soriano wrote that another teacher and several students witnessed the incident, which was also captured on the school's surveillance camera. The boy's parents were notified and came to the school, the report said.
The child's father agreed with school officials that the child should be taken to a mental health facility, the report said. But the mother disagreed, telling officials nothing was wrong with her son. Alvarez said the officer was threatening to take the child to jail if they didn't agree to have him taken to a mental health facility for an evaluation.
The teacher told the officer her back was hurting after the incident but she didn't have any visible injuries. She told officials she intends to press charges, the report said.
School district spokeswoman Jaquelyn Calzadilla said in an email that the boy wasn't actually arrested, but "restrained for transport."
Ian Moffett, the school district's police chief, said in a statement that it was "rare for students this young to be Baker Acted," referring to a Florida law that allows police and certain other officials to initiate an involuntary institutionalization for a psychological evaluation.
"However this action was warranted to prevent his erratic and violent behavior from bringing further harm to others or himself," the statement said.
Moffett said the officer followed standard operating procedures in taking the child to the hospital. However, the district's Professional Compliance Unit is investigating the incident.
Later Monday, school district officials released a report showing this was the second time the boy had been restrained at school and taken to the same hospital for an examination. According to the report, the student punched students and staff members on Nov. 30 and acted aggressively toward Soriano when he responded.
The district says the boy was allowed to ride with a parent to the hospital that time. Alvarez said neither she nor the child's father was allowed to accompany him, either in November or last week.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Perrion Callandret had 23 points on 10-of-14 shooting and Idaho led the entire way in an 81-58 victory over Sacramento State on Saturday night.
Victor Sanders hit a 3 with 3:29 left that sparked a late 9-0 run to help the Vandals (16-7, 8-3 Big Sky) secure their third win in a row and sixth in the last seven.
Idaho doubled up the Hornets (6-17, 3-7) in the first half for a 40-20 lead at the break. Sacramento State scored the first nine points of the second half, but didn't cut the deficit into single digits until a 10-0 run made it 59-50 with seven minutes left. That was as close as they would get.
Brayon Blake added 16 points, Chad Sherwood scored 12 and Jordan Scott 11 for Idaho, which made 10 of 21 from 3-point range.
Joshua Patton led Sacramento State with 16 points. Justin Strings scored 13 and Jeff Wu 11.
WICHITA, Kan. (AP) — A transgender teacher in Kansas has been named "National Educator of the Year" by the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network.
Wichita North High School music teacher Stephanie Byers came out as a transgender woman in 2014, The Wichita Eagle reported.
Byers said she decided to come out as a transgender woman just five years shy of possible retirement, despite her fears about what it could mean for her and those around her.
"There was an urgency to it, and I could no longer put it off," Byers said. "But there's still the fear, because you never know."
Byers said she didn't transition to be a pioneer or an advocate, but that she's become both.
The 55-year-old has in recent years met with school leaders, participated on panels about LGBTQ issues, talked with parents about gender identity, chaperoned a local "Day of Advocacy" and spoken at the state Capitol.
Byers said she's received "absolutely amazing" support from Wichita district officials and from North High Principal Sherman Padgett.
"People that I have never spoken to in this building came up and wrapped their arms around me to tell me how much they care for me and love me and were proud of me," Byers said. "It was very, very affirming."
Padgett said he nominated Byers for the award because she's "just an all-around great teacher and a great person."
"It would be great if we could get to the point where we can normalize the LGBTQ community," said Padgett. "She chose to live her true identity, and when that just becomes normal, that's when kids will realize they belong here just as much as everyone else."

LONDON (AP) — Britain's Supreme Court has ruled against protesters who were arrested and searched by police when Prince William married Kate Middleton more than five years ago.
The country's highest court Wednesday upheld lower court rulings that the Metropolitan Police had acted lawfully when they took some protesters into custody.
The protesters had argued that police violated their human rights and took steps to suppress "anti-monarchist sentiment."
The court found that detaining people for up to five-and-a-half hours had been reasonable in order to prevent possible breaches of the peace.
It said police could be "severely hampered if they were not able to detain somebody for a short period of time."
The case was brought by 20 individuals who were among many arrested the day of the royal wedding in April 2011.
PARIS (AP) — The French mountain climber who was rescued from a Himalayan peak where her climbing partner is presumed to have died is recovering in a French hospital.
Elisabeth Revol has returned to France after she was rescued Sunday from Nanga Parbat mountain — the world's ninth-highest peak at 8,126 meters (26,660 feet.)
Frederic Champly, the doctor responsible for her treatment at the Sallanches hospital near the Mont Blanc massif, said Revol has serious "grade 3 or 4 frostbites."
The rescue team was unable to reach Revol's climbing partner, Tomasz Mackiewicz of Poland, and made the decision to leave him behind.
Revol and Mackiewicz got stuck Thursday while climbing Nanga Parbat.
The European Union is helping Palestinian Authority residents in the southern Hevron Hills to document local Jewish communities, based on information gleaned from photo files taken from a small remote-control aircraft which crashed near the Jewish community of Maon. A Maon resident took it to the Regavim Movement for Preservation of State Lands.
Some of the communities contain Israeli army bases and security antennas. The drones are launched from PA communities without the security establishment knowing about them. Regavim Field Manager Oved Arad said, "The Foreign Ministry must respond strongly and unequivocally against this activity, which is the crossing of a red line and dangerous."

Judge Elizabeth Scherer has determined that Florida shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz is indigent and the 19-year-old will keep his public defender, the State Attorney's Office told ABC News today.A total of 17 students and teachers of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, were shot deadafter Cruz, armed with an AR-15-style rifle, allegedly unleashed his attack on Feb. 14.Cruz has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder and is being held at the Broward County Jail without bond. He has pleaded not guilty but his lawyers said he would change his plea to guilty in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of parole.Scherer came to a decision in her chambers and did not make a formal ruling in the courtroom.A status hearing in Cruz's case is slated for Friday, but it's unclear if Cruz will appear.Cruz's lawyers have said previously that he wished to donate any inheritance due to him from his late mother's estate to the victims' families or an organization that will help the community heal.Cruz stands to collect up to $800,000 from his late mother's estate and various other financial accounts in his name.His mother, Lynda Cruz, died Nov. 1, 2017, after contracting the flu , leaving an Allstate Life Insurance policy to Cruz, according to one of his lawyers.The decision to funnel his fortune to the victims or charities came as more information surfaced that Cruz was set to inherit a windfall."Just so the court is aware, Mr. Cruz does not want those funds," his attorney, Melissa McNeill of the public defender's office, told Scherer during an April 11 hearing. "He would like that money donated to an organization that the victims' families believe would be able to facilitate the healing in our community."There are already numerous lawsuits that are attempting to recover some of Cruz's inheritance. =One lawsuit was filed by one of Cruz's alleged victims, Anthony Borges, in March.The 15-year-old was shot in the gut and the legs while attempting to shield other students from the bullets.Borges' attorney alerted Broward County officials that a grievance against the school district for alleged lapses in preventing the school shooting and protecting the students from harm would be filed."The failure of Broward County Public Schools, and of the principal and school resource officer to adequately protect students, and in particular our client, from life-threatening harm, were unreasonable, callous and negligent," lawyer Alex Arreaza wrote in a letter.A Broward County Public Schools spokeswoman at the time refused to comment citing "potential, pending, or open litigation."

Sixteen-year-old Murad Rahimov peered down into a gigantic space he had only dreamed about before: the world's largest clean room, kept scrupulously free of any dust or contamination, where NASA assembles and tests spacecraft before launch.
Murad's eyes gleamed and a smile played on his face as he took it all in — the scientists encased in sterile white suits; the replica of the massive new space telescope, the most powerful ever built, that will study the first galaxies born after the Big Bang.
Murad is obsessed with space. He has been ever since he was three, back in his home country Uzbekistan. His young imagination was sparked when his aunt gave him a picture book about space, and he couldn't stop looking at the images of the solar system. Soon after, he told his parents his dream: He wanted to become an astronaut and work for NASA.
On this recent day, he was getting a private tour of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., thanks to an NPR listener who heard about Murad's passion for space in a story that aired earlier this year. In January, NPR profiled the Rahimov family on the day they became naturalized as U.S. citizens. The Rahimovs immigrated to the U.S. from Uzbekistan in 2010, when Murad was nine. When they first landed in Kansas City, Murad spoke no English. Now, heading into his junior year of high school, he's on an accelerated track, taking extra classes in the summer and packing his schedule with AP courses.
Listener Aaron Schnittman heard that story on the radio, and his ears perked up when he heard that Murad's goal is to work for NASA. He emailed NPR that same day, that his brother is a research astronomer working for NASA at Goddard. "I think it would be a cool follow up to connect the son to my brother and help him make the connections needed to pursue studies in astronomy," he wrote.
Cool, indeed. The connection was made, emails were exchanged, and last week, at the invitation of Jeremy Schnittman, Murad and his mother, Limara Rahimova, made the trip to Goddard outside Washington, D.C. Schnittman, an astrophysicist who specializes in black holes, spent several hours showing the Rahimovs the inner workings of the space flight center and sharing his enthusiasm for space science.
Murad was clearly in his element, sporting a t-shirt with a picture of the Millennium Falcon spaceship from Star Wars, and a line from the movie: "the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy."
He and his mother got to see the giant cryo-vac chamber where spacecraft are tested to find out if they'll withstand the extreme temperatures of space. They walked inside the acoustic chamber that blasts spacecraft with earsplitting sound to simulate the vibration of launch. They toured the laser lab where scientists are fine-tuning measurements to detect gravitational waves. "Amazing," Murad marveled.
Back in his office, ("black hole central," as he calls it) Schnittman talked with Murad about his research into how light gets bent around black holes. Naturally, they both share a hero in Albert Einstein, whose photo Schnittman keeps pinned above his desk. "It's remarkable," Schnittman said. "It's over 100 years since Einstein did all of this stuff, and still, everything is Einstein. Einstein, Einstein, Einstein."
When Murad mused about the possibilities of time travel, Schnittman sounded optimistic. "It's really not that much of a stretch to say that we're one step closer to time travel," he told Murad. "This is something that Einstein predicted 100 years ago. According to the theory, the equations, time travel should be possible. The trick is just building it and getting it to work, but as far as we can tell, there's no rule against it."
The astrophysicist and the would-be astronaut parted ways with the promise to stay in touch.
Later Murad said he loves science because it shows "the sheer awesomeness, the sheer scale of how insignificant and alone we are in the universe. All these petty fights that people have between themselves, they are just insignificant. When you start thinking about space, you get lost in the vastness of it. That's what captivates me the most."
Now that he's a U.S. citizen, he believes his dream of becoming an astronaut is more within reach. He and his brother automatically became citizens when their parents did. Murad was at school the day they took the oath: "I came home and looked at my parents, and felt all this pride," he said. "You could sense that something has changed. They were smiling from ear to ear."
For his mother, Limara, becoming a U.S. citizen has grounded her in a new way. "I felt before like I'm between countries," she said. "But now I feel like I'm staying ...both my feet here in this land."
Limara works at a school, and each morning they all stand for the pledge of allegiance. Before, she said, "it didn't touch me. But now, yes! And I know what each word in the pledge of allegiance means. And it means, for me, a lot."
As for Murad? The rising high school junior has his sights set on going to Cal Tech, and on the Mars mission he dreams of one day leading. "Some people, they tell me to try to get a real job," he said, "of maybe not shooting so high. But nah. I'm shooting for it. I'm gonna chase my dreams."
Meantime, there's a celestial show about to happen, one he's been excited about for years: the total solar eclipse.
Murad's hometown, Kansas City, is a perfect spot to see it: right in the path of totality.
Next Monday he will be outside, watching in awe as the moon slides over the sun, and dreaming big dreams of space.
SYDNEY (AP) — A hotel valet had a lucky escape — but the luxury sports car he was trying to park did not.
Australian media say the valet drove the soft-top Porsche Carrera under another vehicle Thursday outside the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Sydney.
Emergency workers cut the driver out from the Porsche as a large crowd watched. The driver was reported to be unhurt.
The larger vehicle was propped up and its wheels were anchored so the vehicles could be separated. The black Porsche, its hood and front bumper crunched and dented, was then backed onto a tow truck.
Witness Jonathan Bayle told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. he thought a television show or movie was being shot.
BRISTOL — NASCAR fans that want to see Dale Earnhardt, Jr. on the Bristol Motor Speedway track for the last time will get 2 opportunities.
Junior who announced earlier this year that this will be his final season as a full time driver will race Friday night in the Food City 300 and then again Saturday night in the Bass Pro Shop N-R-A night race.
Junior has won several times on the Xfinity circuit and only one time in a cup race at Bristol, however he still considers it one of his favorite places.
“I love Bristol is a lot of fun to race their I’ve been going there as a little kid that was my favorite to go to was the night race at Bristol, It’s such an exciting race track whether you are on it in the race car or watching it as a fan great place to go see a race it’s just really tough place to win the guys that comes out of here as accomplished quiet a lot is a track where the driver means as much as the race car does.”
Rejecting accusations he is a sexist, Phil Neville said Monday he has the character and status to be a role model after taking on the "ultimate job" as coach of England's women's national soccer team.
The decision to hire the former Manchester United defender brought scrutiny last week because of his lack of coaching experience and his Twitter postings six years ago that were deemed sexist and misogynistic.
"My character stands up to any accusation that has been leveled at me," Neville said after being presented in his new role. "I've lived my life right. I think I have a lot of respect within the game."
Questioned for the first time about the tweets, which he sent in 2011 and '12 when still a player at Everton, Neville said "they aren't right today and they weren't then."
In one of the Twitter posts from 2012, Neville said he thought women would be "busy preparing breakfast/getting kids ready/making beds" instead of watching cricket like men.
The previous year, he said women "always wanted equality until it comes to paying the bills," while another tweet read: "Relax, I'm back chilled- just battered the wife!!! Feel better now!"
Neville defended that tweet by saying he was referring to games of table tennis and basketball he had with his wife on holiday, but accepted he was "disappointed" that he used wording that related to domestic violence.
"That tweet wasn't sent out as a joke to domestic violence," Neville said.
The 41-year-old Neville has taken charge of the No. 3-ranked international team in the women's game, having only had brief spells as an assistant coach with the England under-21 men's team, Man United and Valencia since retiring as a player in 2013.
He believes that is enough.
"I've coached the best players in the men's game at the top level and I believe that the players I'll be coaching in the England women's team are top, top-class players at the elite level," Neville said. "For us to get from third to first in the world, I think they'll need a coach with that type of experience.
"I cannot be more qualified for this job ... The principles that I see in women's football and men's football are very similar. The gap is closing."
Neville said he isn't using the job as a "stepping stone" to other positions in the game.
"This, for me, is the ultimate job," Neville said. "It doesn't get any better than managing your country."

ROME (AP) — Police in northern Italy found a small arsenal of Kalashnikovs, pistols and ammunition hidden in the trunk of a rental car and arrested the Bosnian man who was driving it.
The ANSA news agency says police believe the car, which had Swiss license plates, was headed to Barcelona when they stopped it on a routine check April 19 in Gorizia, near Italy's northeast border with Croatia and Austria.
ANSA says police became suspicious when they found two Berettas in a bag. They then proceeded to search the rest of the car and found several guns in the spare wheel well of the trunk and another stash under the back seat.
The 52-year-old Bosnian was being held on suspicion of possession and transport of weapons of war.

NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — New York City’s First Lady Chirlane McCray answered off-topic questions from the media Wednesday.
She defended how she runs a nonprofit that has seen contributions drop under her leadership.
The Blue Room at City Hall was jam-packed when McCray announced a new initiative to address homelessness among young LGBTQ New Yorkers, but she faced the music alone when it came time to answer questions about her leadership of the Mayor’s Fund to Advance New York City, CBS2’s Marcia Kramer reported.
“The role I play is appropriate,” McCray said.
The first lady was asked to explain published reports that said she often misses board meetings and that her 2017 public schedules recorded less than 20 total hours spent on the Mayor’s Fund business, which raises money for the mayor’s pet causes.
“It is not necessary to go into a room in a building to get the work done,” McCray said. “This is the electronic age. I do business everywhere I am.”

McCray, who prepared for her question-and-answer session with aides, was also asked why the fund has raised less under her stewardship than when Michael Bloomberg was mayor, a man admittedly known to augment programs with his own contributions.
“It’s not a race,” McCray said. “The point is to raise as much money as we need.”
The first lady was also asked about the release of her husband’s secret email cache and his subsequent press conference, which revealed a dim view of the media. CBS2’s Kramer asked about de Blasio’s lack of transparency.
Kramer: “I wonder if you feel, you, yourself, feel that he wasn’t getting a fair shake and that the decision to withdraw, to have one press conference a week, is something that you agree with?”
“I don’t know if what I feel is really relevant to this,” McCray said.
When asked what advice she gives the mayor, McCray said, “I don’t think I have to tell you what we talk about.”
The first lady took off-topic questions for 21 minutes, also confiding that the mayor expressed over the holiday weekend that he has ‘”zero regrets” about the negative things he has said about the New York press corps.

At least 6,000 people, mostly women, are attending the sold out Professional BusinessWomen of California Conference in San Francisco Tuesday.Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, Ashley Judd and Maria Shriver are among the speakers and panelists at the conference, which focuses on empowering women and making improvements in the work place.ABC 7's Cheryl Jennings is serving as emcee and introducing an impressive list of speakers.Kaiser CEO Bernard Tyson talked about his ancestors who were slaves and how he now leads a major American company. "Nobody should own your dreams no matter how high or far you want to go, you can own that," he said."So far, it is more inspirational than expected. I thought it might be a little boring, but the speakers have been great," attendee Jacqui Bellini-Murray said.The 29th Annual Professional BusinessWomen of California Conference is taking place at Moscone Center, and ABC7 is again a proud sponsor.Judd is one of the many dynamic women who are bringing their passion to the conference. Judd is appearing on a panel focusing on the Me Too and Times Up movements.Bay Area Congresswoman Jackie Speier appeared with ABC7's Cheryl Jennings and talked about the conference and how this Me Too discussion is timely and important.Speier and Judd later addressed those at the conference in a discussion about keeping the movement alive. "It's a milestone that we are crossing and we have to do it for our kids and our grandkids and all those women who come after us," said the congresswoman who said one of her greatest fears is that people will forget.Judd urged the women in the audience to set and maintain boundaries and when a problem arises, never go at it alone. "It takes guts to speak up but make sure you cultivate strong female alliances because they make the experience less lonely and more empowering," expressed Judd.This year's theme is "Stand Up, Lift Up." Speier founded the group in 1989. She recently appeared on ABC7's "Beyond the Headlines with Cheryl Jennings" and said this discussion is timely and important. "We are truly changing the culture at work for all time, so that our daughters and granddaughters are never going to have to deal with frankly what we had to deal with," Speier said.The key is to take the energy, lessons and connections out into the business world.Members of the ABC7 News team are leading panels designed to help women gain career confidence, media skills and more.But PBWC goes well beyond this one-day conference. Throughout the year, the organization works with its corporate partners to offer workshops, socials and mentorships - all designed to empower women in the workplace and in their lives.

PHOENIX (AP) — When Ron Barber saw the news that a gunman opened fire on Republican lawmakers practicing for a baseball game, he immediately was taken back to when he was yelling his wife’s name and phone number while lying on a gurney. Pam Simon remembers lying on the ground unable to move after the bullet went through her wrist into her chest.
The attack Wednesday in Virginia that left Rep. Steve Scalise in critical condition brought back painful memories for survivors of another shooting six years ago involving a member of Congress, former Rep. Gabby Giffords, who was shot in Tucson, Arizona.
“It obviously floods back all the memories from Jan. 8,” Simon said. “It really brings it back. You have PTSD symptoms that kind of flare up in things like this.”
Giffords was holding a constituent event outside a grocery store in 2011 when gunman Jared Loughner opened fire, killing six people, including a federal judge and a 9-year-old girl, and shooting Giffords in the head, severely wounding her.
Wednesday’s shooting happened in a similarly public place – a popular park and baseball complex in Alexandria, Virginia. Scalise and other Republican lawmakers were practicing for a charity game when James T. Hodgkinson started shooting and chaos erupted.
Hodgkinson, who had a long history of lashing out at Republicans, was shot and killed by police. Loughner, who is serving life in prison, had posted several online ramblings about politics before he shot Giffords, a Democrat, although in the end no clear motive emerged.
Barber, who took over Giffords’ seat in Congress before narrowly losing a re-election bid in 2014, said Wednesday’s shooting was a reminder of how low political discourse has fallen.
“The vitriol, the harsh rhetoric, the personal attacks, they have escalated to a point where I hardly recognize our political process anymore. We have to stop this,” Barber said.
For others, it prompted strong feelings about keeping weapons out of the hands of the wrong people.
“This isn’t a political issue nor was the one in Tucson,” said Ken Dorushka, who was shot as he shielded his wife from Loughner. “Anybody who would willingly take a gun and shoot somebody is unstable regardless of their political bent.”
Giffords, who now advocates for tighter gun laws through her political action committee she founded with her husband, Mark Kelly, said she was heartbroken.
“This shooting is an attack on all who serve and on all who participate in our democracy,” Giffords said in a written statement Wednesday. “May all Americans come together today with prayers for the survivors, love for their friends and family, and the courage to go about everyday making this country its best. Our nation is resilient, and we always come back stronger.”
Six years ago, Sen. Jeff Flake had rushed from Phoenix to the hospital in Tucson when he heard Giffords was shot. On Wednesday, the Arizona Republican was at the baseball practice and tended to Scalise.
Flake said during an interview with CBS “This Morning” that he reached out to Giffords and Kelly.
“Those of us in Arizona remember well that situation a few years ago. So, I sure hope that this (brings) more unity, we need it around here,” Flake said.
Simon said days like Wednesday don’t feel normal because she gets a lot of calls from friends and reporters. She said she works through the difficult memories by getting together with loved ones and speaking about being positive and encouraging other survivors.
“The physical wounds fade but clearly the emotional ones are there. I have to disagree with the president when he made the statement that the congressman will have a complete recovery. No one who’s been shot ever recovers emotionally,” she said.

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Tom Brady was a mere mortal in Miami.
Again.
The five-time Super Bowl champion wins just about everywhere, just about every week. But games at Miami have been a struggle more times than not for the longtime New England star, and Monday night was yet another entry on that list. Brady was intercepted twice, probably should have had at least one other pass picked off, and the Patriots lost to the Dolphins 27-20 — denying New England a chance to clinch the AFC East.
Brady finished 24 of 43 for 233 yards and a touchdown. He's now 7-9 in his career when visiting the Dolphins, with a passer rating of under 90 in 10 of those 16 games.
His rating Monday: 59.5, his lowest in a regular-season game since 2013.
"We've had a lot of good nights this year," Brady said. "And this was a bad night."
It wasn't all on him, not by a long shot.
The Patriots couldn't run the ball whatsoever, finishing with 10 yards on 25 carries — and that came after running for at least 191 yards in each of their last two games. New England had given up an average of 11.9 points in its last eight games; it gave up 27 to the Dolphins. And the Patriots, in the stat that might be most surprising, were a staggering 0 for 11 on their third-down chances.
The last time they were 0-for-anything on third downs? 1991, when Phoenix — that's what the Cardinals were called then — beat the Patriots.
"That was pretty bad," Brady said. "Can't get any worse than that."
The result was an end to the Patriots' 14-game road winning streak, hardly a great springboard into what's a short week before a showdown in Pittsburgh on Sunday that will likely go a long way toward deciding the top seed in the AFC playoffs.
"They did a good job tonight," Patriots coach Bill Belichick said of the Dolphins, before the rest of his postgame availability became mostly a collage of short, mumbled answers. "They obviously did a better job than we did. We just weren't really good enough in any area, consistent enough in any area to win the game. We all need to do a better job and hopefully we'll be able to do that. This wasn't good enough tonight, across the board."
Brady didn't have his first completion until the second quarter, after missing on his first four throws — one of which was intercepted. The Dolphins went after him all night, never letting him get into rhythm. With no running game and no Rob Gronkowski, serving a one-game suspension over an unnecessary hit he doled out last week, the Patriots needed Brady to be exceptional.
"I've got to throw the ball better," Brady said. "That's where it starts."
The Patriots being the Patriots, they nearly pulled off a comeback from a 27-10 third-quarter deficit anyway. Brady connected with James White for a 3-yard scoring throw early in the fourth, and the Patriots got to the Miami 1 in the final moments. But a pair of penalties pushed them back to the 16, and Stephen Gostowski's 33-yard field goal with 53 seconds left got New England within a touchdown.
That left an onside kick to decide matters. The low-percentage play didn't work, and Belichick was asked afterward what happened.
"They recovered it," Belichick said, then shrugging.
On a night where the Patriots had few answers, at least that one was succinct.
"I wish we played better," Brady said. "But we didn't."

When looking at NFL teams and trying to assess the reasons some of them have fallen below expectations through the first quarter of the season, there is a tendency to do quite a bit of over-analysis.
Instead of finding the issue and coming up with a simple solution, the usual way to address the situation is to change schemes or personnel groupings, and ask players to do things they haven’t done before.
In many cases, those major changes aren’t necessary. It’s much more effective to find the key players and get them to improve their effort and production on the field.
Several key players have not gotten off to the start that was expected of them, and their teams have suffered as a result.
So, let’s look at those players and how they can help turn things around for their respective teams.
Khalil Mack
The Oakland Raiders are 2-2, and the primary reason they have struggled is because their offense has not produced much over the two games.
However, that unit is not likely to pick it up in the next few weeks because quarterback Derek Carr suffered a fractured bone in his back and could miss significant time.
If the Raiders are going to hold their own while Carr is out and win more games than they lose, they need to get a championship-type effort from the defense.
So far, that has not been the case. The Raiders rank 20th in yards allowed and 24th against the run, and if Carr was healthy and the offense was functioning at a high level, the defense’s deficiencies might not be all that worrisome.
Pass rusher Khalil Mack has to become the leader that he has been in the past and help raise the level of the Raiders’ play on that side of the ball. Mack has four sacks this season, but he hasn’t forced or recovered a fumble, and he has deflected just one pass.
He has to do more, and he has to inspire his teammates, starting with this week’s game against Baltimore.
Ezekiel Elliott
The Dallas Cowboys were explosive on offense last year because running back Ezekiel Elliott and quarterback Dak Prescott were the team’s rookie gold-dust twins who could do no wrong.
While Prescott played nearly error-free football and was happy to take what opposing defenses game him, Elliott was a game-breaking running back who rushed for 1,631 yards and averaged 5.1 per carry while pounding the ball into the end zone 15 times. He was also an excellent receiver, with 32 receptions for 363 yards and one TD.
Every time the Cowboys needed a big play, Elliott stepped up. He averaged at least 5.0 yards per carry in seven games in 2016, but has yet to do it once this season.
Elliott has not been running with the same reckless abandon that he did last year, and with a suspension hanging over his head, it’s clear he is distracted. However, the NFL is a prove-it-to-me business, and he has to pick it up.
J.J. Watt
Much has been going right for the Houston Texans since they made rookie Deshaun Watson their starting quarterback.
In the past, the Houston defense, regularly led by all-everything J.J. Watt, was dominant. However, the team didn’t win all that much because it didn’t have the competent quarterback play needed to get the job done.
The Texans are just 2-2. They lost the first game of the season at home to Jacksonville before Watson was named the starter, and they lost their Week 3 matchup at New England. Watson did his part in that game, but the defense could not stop Tom Brady at key moments.
While that’s not necessarily an indictment because Brady does that to nearly every opponent, Watt has not been the same player this year. He has just 13 tackles, two passes batted down and has yet to record a sack.
Watt injured his left ring finger in the Texans’ Week 2 win over Cincinnati, but he has minimized the impact of that injury. He has to find a way to raise his level of play and get back to where he has been in the past.
Ndamukong Suh
The Miami Dolphins have been awful on offense over their last two games, as they scored one garbage time TD against the Jets and they were blanked by the New Orleans Saints.
The offense has problems with Jay Cutler at quarterback in place of injured Ryan Tannehill. It cannot continue for much longer.
But what about the defense, and, specifically, Ndamukong Suh? The defensive tackle is one of the most powerful and strongest players in the league, but he has been known for playing hard only when he wants to. He has a tendency to disappear for weeks at a time.
Suh has 12 tackles and one pass batted down, and has no sacks and hasn’t forced or recovered a fumble. He does not seem fully engaged, and that has to change.
Odell Beckham, Jr.
The Giants are a winless team, and, obviously, are one of the league’s biggest disappointments. Odell Beckham, Jr. is their most talented player, but was nearly invisible the first two weeks of the season. While he picked it up in Week 3 against the Philadelphia Eagles and in Week 4 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Beckham does not display the consistency needed in the effort department to turn the Giants into winners.
Beckham’s numbers are decent — 20 receptions for 202 yards and two touchdowns — but he has never shown the maturity or leadership that a great player should. Head coach Ben McAdoo has either unable to reach him or is afraid to show him who is boss. Until the multi-talented receiver takes his role more seriously, the Giants will continue to disappoint.

NEW YORK (AP) — McDonald's says it has reached a settlement with a U.S. labor agency over a lawsuit that could have decided if the fast-food company should be liable for hiring, pay and other decisions made at its franchised restaurants.
The lawsuit, filed in 2016 by the National Labor Relations Board, contended that McDonald's should be considered a "joint employer" with its franchises. But the settlement, if approved by a judge, would squash that.
NLRB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
McDonald's Corp., based in Oak Brook, Illinois, says the settlement is the first step toward ending "wasteful multi-year litigation."

NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. (AP) — The aerialist wife of daredevil Nik Wallenda is preparing for a stunt that will have her hanging by her teeth from a helicopter over Niagara Falls.
Thursday morning's performance comes on the fifth anniversary of Nik Wallenda's televised high-wire walk over Niagara Falls.
Plans call for Erendira (AR'-en-deer-uh) Wallenda to be tethered by her waist as she performs a series of maneuvers on a hoop suspended from a helicopter 300 feet (91 meters) above the water. At one point she'll hang from her toes. At another, her teeth.
The Wallendas say the stunt will break a height record Nik Wallenda set in 2011 when he hung by his teeth 250 feet (76 meters) above Silver Dollar City in Branson, Missouri.
The Niagara County Legislature set aside $35,000 for the act last month.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano says Trump administration has yet to be in touch about their criticism of the Iran nuclear deal.
The head of the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Tuesday that the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has yet to be in touch with him or others about their criticism of the Iran nuclear deal.
Speaking to The Associated Press, Yukiya Amano said his organization was "in constant touch" with the U.S., but had yet to hear from the new administration on their concerns.
"I'm expecting to have direct contact with the new administration very soon," Amano said.
Trump has been highly critical of the Iran nuclear deal, saying it was “disastrous” and pledging to annul it.
Most recently, Trump described the nuclear deal as “the worst deal I’ve ever seen negotiated” and accused the Islamic Republic of “disrespecting” the United States because of the deal.
Iranian officials, however, have downplayed Trump’s threats to annul the nuclear deal, insisting he cannot do so even if he wishes.
Several weeks ago, Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said that Trump would be “surprised” by his country if he annuls the deal, but did not explain what he meant by that.
Amano told AP the Iranian government also had yet to reach out on Trump's comments, though it remained in touch with UN atomic officials. He mentioned his trip in December to Tehran, in which he met President Hassan Rouhani and others.
"Why not meet again in the near future?" he told the news agency.
Amano further noted that the deal has held up despite a "number of events," like Iran slightly exceeding its heavy water allotment.
"We have been monitoring," he stressed. "When there's a certain indication, we can detect it immediately."
Since the implementation of the deal, Iran was found several times to have exceeded the amount of heavy water it is permitted to produce under the agreement. The IAEA determined that those violations were minor.
In September, the IAEA indicated that Iran had kept to the nuclear deal to which it agreed with six world powers, which limits its stockpiles of substances that could be used to make atomic weapons.
Amano stressed on Tuesday that Iran's stockpile of low-enriched uranium remained below the level required of the nuclear accord.
"The IAEA is functioning as the eyes and ears of the international community," he told AP.
A father was gunned down right in front of his family. Police are calling him a victim of road rage. Police have very few leads, so the victim's family is making an emotional plea."He was a big old teddy bear," said Leilani Millard of her husband Wardell Taliaferro. She only has a few pictures of him. They were focused on growing their family. Their son Luke is just three months old."As for a husband, provider, family, brother, definitely it--he loved everybody," Millard said.On Sunday the couple, their baby and five-year-old were driving to a friend's house along Marina Boulevard near Verna Court when something happened between Taliaferro and another driver."As they were driving they were swerving out of each other's lanes," said Wardell's brother Joe Toro. "Exchanging words and when came to a stop, before you know it they pulled out a gun."The 45-year-old was shot in the head. His wife jumped into the driver's seat and drove the car to a nearby Kaiser, but Wardell was already dead."I couldn't believe it," said friend Rose Thompson. "It's surreal."No one can believe it. Taliaferro's family is one that sees one another daily.While their mother kept them all connected, Taliaferro kept them smiling."He always made sure we always laughed," said his niece Carla Bonds. "He always made light of any situation."This situation, however; is one no one ever expected.

In most weeks on the PGA Tour, it's the players that rule the discussion for the individual events, which march along week to week without much fanfare outside those that regularly follow the game.
All that is changed on U.S. Open week, when the stakes are raised and the course steals the limelight.
This year, Erin Hills in the rural Wisconsin town of Erin (about 35 miles northwest of Milwaukee) is the host course for the 117th edition of America's golf championship. And it's a bit of a mystery to those players from around the world who will tee it up beginning Thursday.
Part of the intrigue surrounding this championship is that the players chasing the second major of the season are as much in the dark about how this big-shouldered, fescue-framed, inland links course will play as those of us who will be watching.
Erin Hills, which can be stretched to more than 8,200 yards from its back tees, will play at 7,741 yards and to a par of 72. It will be the first par-72 setup in a U.S. Open since 1992, when Pebble Beach Golf Links hosted and ninth since World War II.
"It's a well-designed, well-bunkered golf course with a bunch of tee box options," 2015 U.S. Open winner Jordan Spieth said. "It's kind of tough to prepare because there's three or four tee boxes on almost every hole that we could be playing from. We'll just get out there and just see what they give to us.
"At the U.S. Open it's very tough but still fair and exciting, and you expect par to be an extremely good score. I think that's knowledge. And here, with my early thoughts, I don't see par winning the tournament. I see closer to 5- to 10-under.
"Someone who has very good control of the ball off the tee will have plenty of opportunities to make birdies, given the conditions that we're expecting. And I think the USGA is very much OK with that."
It's the third course in the last decade to host a U.S. Open for the first time (after Torrey Pines in 2008 and Chambers Bay in 2015). It is also the first course in the state of Wisconsin to host a U.S. Open and the first U.S. Open to be held in the American Midwest since 2003 when Olympia Fields, outside Chicago, hosted.
The 2017 U.S. Open generated 9,485 entries, the fifth-highest in history. To be eligible, a player must have a handicap not exceeding 1.4, or be a professional.
A field of 156 players will chase the $12 million total purse, of which $2.16 million and 600 FedExCup points will go to the winner. The field will be cut to the top 60 and those players tied at that standing after 36 of the 72 holes, and there will be an 18-hole playoff on Monday if there is a tie after regulation play ends Sunday evening.
Forty-nine of the top 50 players in the world -- led by world No. 1 and defending champion Dustin Johnson -- will compete in the event. Ryan Moore is the lone player missing from that group due to a shoulder injury.
The field includes 25 major championship winners, led by five-time winner Phil Mickelson, Ernie Els of South Africa (who has won four majors), Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland (four), Angel Cabrera of Argentina (two), Zach Johnson (two), Martin Kaymer of Germany (two), Spieth (two), Bubba Watson (two), Lucas Glover, Graeme McDowell of Northern Ireland, Danny Willett and Justin Rose of England, Webb Simpson, Sergio Garcia of Spain, Jason Day and Adam Scott of Australia, Henrik Stenson of Sweden, Jason Dufner, Jimmy Walker, Jim Furyk, Charl Schwartzel and Louis Oosthuizen of South Africa, Keegan Bradley and Stewart Cink.
McIlroy, who has been away from the PGA Tour since The Players Championship last month as he rehabs a rib injury, has had more time than most to see how Erin Hills will play.
"One of the course architects, Dana Fry, walked around the course with us which I thought was really beneficial," McIlroy said Monday. "From what I've seen so far, it's really good. I feel like you can be aggressive off the tee and be aggressive with your approach shots. If you do miss a green, it's not that you're going to be chipping out of the thick rough. It goes in these collection areas and runoffs. It's a little bit of a different challenge than what we faced in U.S. Opens in the past."
There are also 14 amateur participants competing in the event. The U.S. Open has had eight amateur winners (five players), most recently John Goodman in 1933. The last amateur to finish inside the top 15 was Spencer Levin (who tied for 13th) in 2004 at Shinnecock Hills.
Following the third round of the 2017 Memorial Tournament, Mickelson announced that he will likely not be competing in the U.S. Open at Erin Hills, due to a time conflict with the high school graduation of his daughter, Amanda.
NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — Hearts were broken in Westchester County when an eighth grader, and rising basketball star was killed by a stray bullet.
Now, her mother, coach, and others in the grief-stricken community are pleading for the shooter to come forward.
As CBS2’s Ali Bauman reported, police said the girl was not even the intended target of the shooting, and now the parents of Shamoya McKenzie have to enter the New Year without the daughter who was their world.
White balloons were released into the sky by 13-year-old McKenzie’s teammates. She was struck and killed by a stray bullet on Saturday afternoon.
“Oh my God, my Angel is gone!” her mother Nadine cried.
McKenzie had been driving her daughter home from basketball practice. They were on Pease Street near East 3rd Street when she said suddenly she heard gunshots and hear her daughter cry out.
“I thought she was playing, I didn’t know she really got shot until I see the big hole in my window,” she said.

Police said the eighth grader was no the intended target — a chilling statement for those gathered at her memorial on Sunday.
“She’s just in the car, you know it could’ve been anyone. I could be riding with my son that same route,” Dorotie Bereen said.
The 6 ft tall McKenzie was a rising athletic star. Her basketball coach said she dreamed of playing at UConn and in the WNBA.
On Monday, her coach and all who knew her wanted to know who took those dreams away.
“I know there’s somebody out there who knows something. Please catch this person, please find out what happened,” coach David Newton said.
Police believe a 28-year-old man may have been the intended target. He too was hit by gunshots and is in the hospital, but sources told CBS2 he was not cooperating with police to help find the killer.
LAKE HAVASU CITY, Ariz. (AP) — Luke Air Force Base officials say an F-16C from the 56th Fighter Wing crashed while attempting to land at a municipal airport in Arizona. The pilot ejected and wasn't seriously injured.
Officials say the jet was on a training flight Tuesday when it diverted to the Lake Havasu City airport and went off the runway while landing, prompting the pilot to eject.
Staff Sgt. Jenna Bigham says the pilot is in good condition and was transported to a hospital.
She says she couldn't provide information on why the plane diverted.
The Today's News-Herald newspaper posted a photo showing the plane apparently missing the nose area of its fuselage.
Lake Havasu City is 134 miles (216 kilometers) northwest of Luke, located in Glendale, a suburb of Phoenix.
President of Israel Reuven Rivlin spoke today at the judge's swearing-in ceremony held at the President's Residence, and criticized the Legal Advisor's bill promoted by Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked that would change the manner of selecting legal advisors in government ministries from choosing through tender to selection by a sitting minister in accordance with a search committee's recommendation.
"Elected officials were chosen to formulate a policy and implement it for the public. The legal advisors must use all professional tools at their disposal to assist elected officials in fulfilling the elected government's policy. However, this doesn't contradict the basic and first obligation of the legal advisor to the law, which in itself is a clear expression of the public's will," Rivlin said.

"A legal advisor must make an effort to assist the public official in realizing his policy but at the same time he must help him understand the boundaries within which he may act - the limits of the law, as determined by the legislator. This is the role of the legal advisor. And this is the image of the legal advisor we deserve.
"Legal advisors like all of us are human beings. Some are better and some are less good, although in my experience they've generally been very good. The Civil Service must find a way to ensure that its legal advisors are the best of the best. Legal advisors who offer their professional tools to help elected officials implement the policy of the elected government. Legal advisors who see themselves as committed to government policy, and to the policy of the ministry, led by the elected public.
"At the same time, we need independent legal advisors whose commitment to the law and being gatekeepers flows in their veins and constitutes the essence of their professional ethic. I understand elected officials. I too served in one or two roles before I reached this house, and I didn't always agree with the legal advisor's position. However, I believe we must be careful not to weaken one of the important pillars of the executive branch in Israeli democracy."
Rivlin added, "We all want a legal advisor who'll serve all elected officials from anywhere in the political spectrum in exactly the same way. Faithfully, devotedly, professionally, committed to government policy and primarily responsibility to uphold the law."
The good news? Those embarrassing SSD bugs in Windows 10 version 1803 seem to be fixed. The bad news? Just about everything else.
Once more we have a monthly Windows/Office patch scorecard that needs a guidebook. Or two. And we just got a handful of buried warnings about problems in old patches, plus a brand new way to fry your network interface card.
Thus continues the tradition of two cumulative updates per month for all of the supported Windows 10 versions – that’s eight cumulative updates in total – in addition to bobs and weaves and a very long list of acknowledged bugs introduced by recent security patches in Windows 7.
Conflicts with Remote Desktop
The strange behavior of the CredSSP update – where the Patch Tuesday fixes for all versions of Windows seemed to break Remote Desktop Protocol with a strange error message: “This could be due to CredSSP encryption oracle remediation” has been resolved.
Patch Lady Susan Bradley notes (about all versions of Windows and Remote access):
Be aware — if you are seeing RDP issues post patch Tuesday, the underlying issue is that there is a mismatch between patch levels. The updates for the RDP/credssp came out in March and slowly Microsoft has been adjusting the mandate of the update. In May, the full “you must have a patch on both ends” kicked in. So if you haven’t updated your servers, but your workstations got patched you’ll see the CredSSP error message.
While there is a registry key to allow patched systems to connect to unpatched systems, it’s much wiser to patch your servers. Note that if you held off patching your servers because of the networking side effects/bugs, those were patched in the April.
That’s how you solve a CredSSP encryption oracle remediation problem. Obviously. Ahem.
Win10 version 1803 approaches 'usable' status
The unpaid beta testers for Windows 10 April 2018 Update (better known as version 1803) earned their salaries this month, with triple overtime. The embarrassing bug in the original 1803 (released April 30) bricked any computer with an Intel SSD6 drive– including some of Microsoft’s own Surface Pro 2017 computers.
A similar, but different, bug dogged PCs with Toshiba SSDs. The bug persisted in the first cumulative update for Win10 1803, but was finally put to sleep last week with the second cumulative update, which finally made 1803 installable on most common PCs.
Installable, mind you. Not stable. For example, there are many reports of 1803 driving batteries nuts. I’ve seen discussions of the Surface Studio mouse and keyboard lock-ups after installing 1803, but no solutions – and there may be a similar problem with earlier versions of Win10. The Reddit 1803 megathread is up to 1,800 comments– not all of which are glowing reports of happiness in 1803 land.
The greatest malfeasance, in my opinion, is Microsoft’s continuing push to install Win10 1803 on machines that are set to specifically avoid it. Win10 1709 Home users get hit the worst. AskWoody reader IG puts it this way:
I have found that (at least in my situation with my Lenovo and HP laptops) the best way to avoid the latest feature update for Windows 10 Home, is to not only set your connection to metered, but to also install the Windows update tool, (wushowhide). Despite being on a metered connection, the 1803 upgrade eventually showed up ‘available to download’ this week. Along with the 1803 update a 1709 update also showed up but required a ‘retry.’ Using the update tool I hid the 1803 upgrade, and the next time Windows automatically checked for updates, it was no longer available to download. I was also able to retry and install the current 1709 update without any issues.
I continue to strongly recommend that you not hobnob with the cannon fodder and wait for Microsoft to show some restraint. Or at least some fixes. My original recommendations for blocking 1803 still work, but you have to use all of them, altogether, all the time.
Multiple patches for all versions of Windows 10
If you’re using Windows 10, you saw big multiple patches in April:
Version 1709– the Fall Creators Update — the initial Patch Tuesday patch, KB 4103727, had the usual round of complaints about failure to install, random bluescreens and the like. The second cumulative update, KB 4103714, seems to be stable.
Version 1703— the Creators Update — got its first cumulative update, KB 4103731, on Patch Tuesday, and a second huge cumulative update, KB 4103722a week later.
Version 1607— the Anniversary Update (only for Win10 1607 Enterprise and Education) also got two cumulative updates.
Version 1703 remains stable (although there’s a whole lotta patchin’ goin’ on) and 1709 has finally found some maturity. About a month too late.
The ongoing Windows 7/Server 2008 R2 saga
Windows 7 continues to be singled out for back-breaking patch-induced bugs. Microsoft officially acknowledges both of these bugsin the latest Win7/Server 2008 R2 patch, KB 4103718:
A stop error occurs on computers that don't support Streaming Single Instructions Multiple Data (SIMD) Extensions 2 (SSE2). A long-standing problem, still with no solution.
There is an issue with Windows and a third-party software that is related to a missing file (oem.inf). Because of this issue, after you apply this update, the network interface controller will stop working.That announcement appeared out of the blue on May 26. There’s no indication which “third-party software” is at fault – or who should avoid the patch – but such are the vagaries of Windows patching. There’s an in-depth discussion going on the AskWoody Lounge.
As it turns out, the missing oem.inf issue dates back to the March patches. According to an anonymous poster:
It’s not only KB4103718 (May 8, 2018—KB4103718 (Monthly Rollup)) that has been updated last Friday with the missing oem.inf issue. The problem seems to date back to the March 2018 Security-Only and Monthly Rollup updates.
All of the following knowledge base articles were updated with similar warnings on May 25:
KB4088875: March 13, 2018—KB4088875 (Monthly Rollup)
KB4088878: March 13, 2018—KB4088878 (Security-only update)
KB4088881: March 23, 2018—KB4088881 (Preview of Monthly Rollup)
KB4093118: April 10, 2018—KB4093118 (Monthly Rollup)
KB4093113: April 17, 2018—KB4093113 (Preview of Monthly Rollup)
KB4103718: May 8, 2018—KB4103718 (Monthly Rollup)
KB4103713: May 17, 2018—KB4103713 (Preview of Monthly Rollup)
We’re stuck between a rock and a hard place. Microsoft won’t say which vendor(s) and/or which network card(s) are getting cracked by the patch. There’s speculation that the bad card is from Intel, but we really don’t know. Your only real recourse is to create a full backup prior to applying this month’s patches, or to accept the possibility that you’ll have to manually re-install them. Susan Bradley has detailed instructions.
That same anonymous poster goes on to advise:
Also, there is a new, never heard before issue with the Win7 March 2018 Security-only update (KB4088878):
Symptom: A 32-bit (x86) computer won’t boot or keeps restarting after applying this security update.
Workaround: Before applying this security update and subsequent security updates, uninstall the following external drivers until they are fixed by the vendor that owns them:
HASP Kernel Device Driver (a.k.a. Haspnt.sys)
Hard Lock Key Drivers (a.k.a. hardlock.sys)
It’s not at all clear if that warning is only for 32-bit computers.
If you want to see something scary, take a look at the current version of the “Known issues” list for the Win7 Security-only patch, KB 4088878. I count nine acknowledged bugs introduced in that one Security-only patch.
Windows 8.1 / Server 2012 R2 continues to look good. By any objective measure, 8.1 is Microsoft’s most stable version of Windows. By a long shot.
NEW YORK (AP) — Sinclair Broadcast Group will sell nine TV stations to Standard Media Group for $441.7 million as part of its plan to meet regulatory approval for its pending $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media.
The sale of the stations is contingent on the Tribune deal closing. Sinclair said it expects that deal to close by the end of the second quarter.
The moves come after Sinclair received widespread attention after news reports earlier in April showed dozens of Sinclair news anchors reading an identical script expressing concern about "one-sided news stories plaguing the country." At the time, President Donald Trump tweeted his support of the network.
The stations include one each in Oklahoma, Michigan, North Carolina, Virginia and Iowa and four in Pennsylvania.
Sinclair owns 193 stations across the country.

CLEVELAND (WFAN) — This is what the Yankees are now up against.
To advance to the AL Championship Series the Bombers have to win three out of four against a juggernaut Indians team that has lost only four of its last 38 games. And they will have to do it by going through the best pitcher in the league twice.
That’s Corey Kluber, and the Indians did actually lose three consecutive Kluber starts in some freaky, fluky stretch in July. But the task facing the Yankees is obviously gigantic.
MORE: Palladino: Trouble With The Curve? Yankees Didn’t Have A Clue In Game 1
Kluber was 18-4 during the regular season and his 265 strikeouts were second only to the Red Sox’s Chris Sale. Kluber led the American League in ERA (2.25) and WHIP (0.869), and threw five complete games, including three shutouts.
The Yanks saw Kluber twice in August. The schedule makers must have been conspiring to keep them away from his July losing streak. On Aug. 3 in Cleveland, Kluber fired a three-hitter with 11 strikeouts in a 5-1 victory. Then on Aug. 28 in the Bronx, the impressive right-hander tossed eight innings of three-hit ball in a 6-2 victory.
Overall, the Yankees have now faced Kluber seven times. He’s 5-1 with a 1.80 ERA in that span and the Bombers have scored a grand total of 13 runs (10 earned).
This isn’t a tall order. This is an extra venti grande, or whatever you’re supposed to call them. Small, medium, and large work just fine for the rest of the world, so why do we have to … never mind. Back to the point. This is going to be hard.
But this is sports, remember? Where you believe anything can happen when the bounces go the right way. And the guy on the other side can make his statement, too. That’s the ageless CC Sabathia.
Sabathia, who will be making his 20th postseason appearance, has waited a long time to get back here. He was a playoff fixture when he pitched in six straight Octobers for the Indians, Brewers, and Yankees from 2007–12. But he hasn’t pitched a playoff game since the 2012 ALCS, the series that began with Derek Jeter breaking his ankle and ended with the Yankees being swept by the Tigers.
Sabathia has waited through six trips to the disabled list, a couple of knee surgeries, and one trip to alcohol rehab to get back to this place. And it’s in the same building where he made his name, where 17-year-old Sabathia sat next to his mom and signed his first pro contract.
Two decades later, the 37-year-old southpaw is preparing to pitch what could be his last game in a Yankees uniform. He has the power to extend this season and his career if he can go toe-to-toe with Kluber on Friday afternoon.
These Yankees have clung all year to the idea that nobody thought they would get this far in 2017. So now they need to use some of that same resolve, because there aren’t many who believe they can overcome this obstacle, either.

DALLAS (AP) — CORRECTS: Grand jury finds no wrongdoing in police actions during 2016 Dallas ambush that left five officers dead. (Corrects APNewsAlert the ambush happened in 2016, not last July 7.)
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Blockchain technology can make transactions safe and secure, but crypto-currency exchanges trading bitcoins and other virtual currencies that are based on this technology have been hacked because they are not working on secure networks, experts say. Late last week, the Tokyo-based Coincheck exchange reported a 58 billion yen ($530 million) loss of crypto currency due to hacking. The Coincheck exchange has halted trading of the stolen currency, NEM and restricted dealings in most other crypto currencies. It was the second major hacking assault on a Japanese crypto exchange after the Mt. Gox debacle in 2014. Here's a look at the security concerns surrounding crypto currencies.
___
WHAT IS BLOCKCHAIN?
As its name implies, blockchain is a chain of digital "blocks" that contain records of transactions, says Curtis Miles at IBM Blockchain. Each such block is connected to those before and behind it, making tampering difficult because a hacker would need to change the block containing that record and all those linked to it to avoid detection. The records on a blockchain are secured through cryptography and network participants have private keys assigned to their transactions that act as personal digital signatures. Any alteration will make those signatures invalid and alert others in the network to the changes. Blockchains are kept in so-called "peer-to-peer" networks that are continually updated and synchronized. Huge amounts of computing power would be required to access every instance of a certain blockchain and alter all its blocks simultaneously.
___
POOR SECURITY
While a blockchain can be secure, the exchanges that are crucial in increasing the amount of crypto trading, enabling bitcoin and other such currencies go mainstream, do not use the same technology, says Simon Choi, a director at anti-virus software company Hauri Inc. South Korean exchanges reportedly get poor reviews for cyber security, and officials have said those that fail to beef up such precautions will face fines. "If security on the exchanges' is not secure, their currencies can be stolen," Choi said. "If the exchanges are to play their intermediary role, they should be as safe as banks and strengthen their security."
___
RISING HACKS
According to crypto currency research firm Chainalysis, losses of bitcoin, including stealing individuals' holdings through scams, malicious computer software known as ransom ware and hacks, increased at least 30 times to $95 million in 2016 from at least $3 million in 2013.
The attack on Coincheck, which did not affect its holdings of bitcoin, was the second major hacking assault on a Japanese crypto exchange after Mt. Gox, the world's largest bitcoin trading exchange before its collapse, lost hundreds of thousands of bitcoins likely stolen through hacking.
Coincheck has apologized and promised to reimburse customers for their NEM losses. It has pledged to comply with a Financial Services Agency's order to determine why the losses happened, and improve its security to prevent a recurrence.
Details of how the losses happened or who might be behind them are still unclear.
The Mt. Gox case put many Japanese investors off bitcoin, at least for a time, and prompted authorities to impose more regulations. Chainalysis estimates that the bitcoins lost at Mt. Gox were worth $7.5 million at the time the coins were stolen but now worth nearly $10 billion as of January.

IDENTIFYING HACKERS
It's possible to trace blockchain transactions but not to identify the owners of the "wallets" where the crypto currencies are kept, says Choi.
"It's the biggest weakness," said Choi. "You can track the blocks based on the records in the blocks but you cannot tell whose wallet it is. They went to hackers' wallet but if we don't know who the hackers are we cannot catch them."
The rising hacks have prompted the crypto community to seek ways to halt the bad guys.
South Korea's government is trying to make crypto transactions traceable by implementing a system that links crypto accounts to existing bank accounts that have been vetted by financial institutions. Such efforts however will not help identify hackers if they send crypto currencies to exchanges outside Korea that do not identify their users.

In our city’s darkest hour, @FDNY firefighter Thomas Phelan’s heroism saved hundreds of lives. We will never forget his service and his sacrifice. https://t.co/dRn4xVFDza — Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) March 18, 2018
A 9/11 emergency responder who saved hundreds following the attack in 2011 has died of cancer at age 45.Authorities said Thomas Phelan, a New York ferry captain who later became a city firefighter, died Friday.The New York City Fire Department said when the Twin Towers were hit, Phelan helped ferry people from Lower Manhattan.In 2003, Phelan joined the FDNY as a firefighter and was promoted to Marine pilot, according to authorities.Mayor Bill de Blasio sent a tweet Sunday honoring Phelan's service and sacrifice.Phelan is one of the thousands of victims of cancer linked to the 9/11 attack.His funeral is scheduled for Tuesday in Brooklyn.
President Donald Trump will visit New Hampshire on Monday to unveil a series of new steps aimed at combating the opioid crisis in what the administration is billing as his "initiative to Stop Opioid Abuse and Reduce Drug Supply and Demand."Among the steps announced in the initiative is a call for the Department of Justice to "seek the death penalty against drug traffickers, where appropriate under current law."However, a previous draft proposal of the initiative obtained by ABC News seemed to take a harder line on what the administration might pursue regarding use of the death penalty against drug traffickers."The death penalty should be sought for certain cases where opioid, including Fentanyl-related, drug dealing and trafficking are directly responsible for death," the previous draft read.The administration could not provide information about when it would currently be appropriate to seek the death penalty under current law for trafficking drugs.Trump has previously suggested dealers face the death penalty. At an opioid summit earlier this month, Trump said dealers should face "the ultimate penalty" for their roles in drug-related deaths."You know, if you shoot one person, they give you life, they give you the death penalty," Trump said. "These people can kill 2,000, 3,000 people and nothing happens to them. Some countries have a very, very tough penalty -- the ultimate penalty. And, by the way, they have much less of a drug problem than we do."Trump's announcement Monday comes more than four months after he declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency, though the decision faced criticism as it stopped short of a national emergency declaration that would have made an additional surge of federal funds available to address treatment and recovery efforts.Other proposals in the plan include many recommendations previously put forward by the president's opioid commission last November, including the launch of a nationwide public awareness campaign to educate on the dangers of prescription and opioid abuse; the implementation of a "safer prescribing plan" aimed at cutting nationwide opioid prescription fills by a third over the next three years; calling on Congress to pass legislation that reduces the threshold amount of drugs needed to invoke mandatory minimum sentences for drug traffickers who knowingly distribute certain illicit opioids that are lethal in trace amounts; and working to ensure first responders are supplied with naloxone, a lifesaving medication used to reverse overdoses.The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has labeled the country's opioid problems an "epidemic." There were over 42,000 deaths from opioid use, including fentanyl , heroin and prescription drugs , in 2016, according to the CDC. Deaths were five times higher than they were just 17 years earlier, the CDC reported.In New Hampshire, 39 people per 100,000 died of opioid drug overdoses in 2016 -- the third-highest rate in the country. Only West Virginia and Ohio reported worse rates in 2016, according to the CDC.

MADRID (AP) — Girona avoided conceding late this time, holding on to beat Catalan rival Espanyol 1-0 in the Spanish league on Monday.
After allowing injury-time goals in its last two league matches, Girona closed out the game at Espanyol to halt a four-game winless streak in all competitions.
David Timor scored in the first top-flight meeting between the Catalan clubs just before halftime at RCDE Stadium in Barcelona, moving Girona to ninth place.
It was the fourth loss in five league matches for Espanyol, which dropped to 16th in the 20-team standings, near the relegation zone.
"We started well but in the end it was another loss," Espanyol goalkeeper Pau Lopez said. "It has been a very bad season so far."
Girona conceded injury-time goals in a draw at Real Betis two weeks ago, and in a loss against Alaves last week.

PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — An appeals court in Cambodia has for the second time denied a request for the release on bail of opposition leader Kem Sokha, who has been charged with treason.
The Thursday court appearance in Phnom Penh by Kem Sokha, head of the Cambodia National Rescue Party, was his first since his arrest last September. His hearing was held behind closed doors and journalists and other onlookers were kept away.
His prosecution by the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen is widely seen as part of a concerted effort to cripple the opposition ahead of a general election this year.
Kem Sokha's lawyer, Choung Choungy, says the court cited concerns for his client's security in denying bail.
The government has expressed fears of political protests by Kem Sokha's supporters.
If you just celebrated Easter, you might have some stale marshmallow Peeps lying around the house. And if you want to avoid eating those Peeps, they are the perfect material for a science experiment you can do in your own kitchen.
With the help of a ruler and a microwave, you can use leftover Peeps to calculate one of the constants of the universe — the speed of light.
It might sound crazy, but all will be revealed in this video from NPR's science YouTube channel, Skunk Bear. As a bonus, you'll also get to see animated Peeps illustrate the history of the search for the speed of light going back to Galileo.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Melania Trump and Brigitte Macron have ditched the White House for the nearby National Gallery of Art to see the works of Paul Cezanne.
Wearing white suits and high heels, the first ladies of the United States and France toured an exhibit of about 60 works by the French post-impressionist painter.
They paused near a portrait of Cézanne's father reading a newspaper. Mary Morton, the musem's curator of French paintings, explained that Cezanne had a difficult relationship with his father, who was a banker.
The two first ladies then strolled through the building's Rotunda and past a statue of Mercury.
It was the second day of French President Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron's visit to Washington. Later Tuesday, the Trumps are hosting the couple at the administration's first state dinner.

Brandon Kent Sundeen, of Devils Lake, faces terrorizing, driving under the influence and assault charges after reports he was waving a gun early Tuesday morning at Thirsty's Bar in downtown Devils Lake.
Peter Owlboy Jr. told the Forum News Service that Sundeen was outside the bar and appeared drunk and ready to fight. Sundeen also pointed a gun at Owlboy's chest, the victim said, adding he feared for his life.
Sundeen eventually left after calming down, Owlboy said.
Devils Lake Police said they later pulled Sundeen over and booked him at the Lake Region Law Enforcement Center.
Charges had not been filed against Sundeen as of Tuesday evening.

NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — A 30-year-old man and 5-year-old child were killed when an out of control SUV slammed into the back of a tractor-trailer on the George Washington Bridge on Wednesday night.
All upper inbound lanes were closed for hours overnight as police investigated the crash which happened around 10 p.m. Wednesday.
Police said an SUV with New Jersey plates was driving eastbound on the upper level with five people inside — an adult man and woman, a 70-year-old woman, a 5-year-old child and an infant.
The car crashed into the back of a tractor-trailer that was stopped in traffic, CBS2’s Ali Bauman reported.
All five were taken to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, where the man and 5-year-old child were pronounced dead.
Authorities said the two women and the infant sustained minor injuries, but are expected to be OK.
Traffic was backed up for hours following the crash. All upper and lower levels were back open to traffic by Thursday morning.
The names of the victims have not been released.
The investigation is ongoing.
JOHNSON CITY, TN (WJHL) – On Tuesday, three area attorneys general — Barry Staubus, Tony Clark and Dan Armstrong — announced a joint lawsuit against a prescription drug manufacturer, filing it on behalf of a local baby was born exposed to drugs.
The lawsuit seeks damages for what it calls breaches of statutory and common law, restitution to the plaintiffs, and an injunction to stop what it calls “the flood of opioids to the region.”
A day later, the company – Purdue Pharma L.P. denies the allegations, but said they are dedicated to finding a solution to what they referred to as a “public health crisis.”
The following is a statement from Purdue Pharma:
While we vigorously deny the allegations in the complaint, we share public officials’ concerns about the opioid crisis and we are committed to working collaboratively to find solutions. At Purdue, we have dedicated ourselves to working with policymakers, public health officials and law enforcement to address this public health crisis, which include developing abuse-deterrent technology, advocating for the use of prescription drug monitoring programs and supporting access to Naloxone. Addiction and drug abuse are multi-faceted problems that require multi-faceted solutions. Pointing fingers will not solve the problem, nor will it help those who are suffering. We urge all stakeholders to seize the opportunity to work together so that collectively we can address this crisis.”

Bass: The fishing has been great. There are some fish that are finishing up spawning, and there are some that are on their way out to their summer staging areas. I’ve been starting my mornings out throwing topwater, with my baits of choice being a Strike King Sexy Dawg and a Whopper Plopper. I’m throwing these around brush, backs of pockets and spawning flats targeting the fish before they make their way back out to deeper water. There is also fish guarding fry around brush and docks. These areas are good places to throw a Fluke.
Once the sun gets up, I’m targeting the long points and spawning flats with a tube, shaky head and jig in depths around 12 to 20 feet. As the water gets warmer and the fish go to their summer pattern, I will start targeting these fish with a drop shot, Strike King Ocho rigged Neko with a 1/16 Tungsten nail weight and a shaky head. If you have a windy day, throw a 3/8 ounce white spinnerbait. As the fish start moving out deeper and off shore, you will start seeing them on your electronics.

HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong lawmakers have given final approval to a government proposal banning local ivory trading in the Chinese territory by 2021.
Lawmakers voted Wednesday in favor of amending the existing law to outlaw sales of ivory in Hong Kong, which researchers say is the world's biggest retail ivory market.
The proposal also includes significantly stiffer penalties for wildlife smuggling to deter black market sales.
Under the new law, the maximum sentence will increase to a 10 million Hong Kong dollar ($1.3 million) fine or 10 years in prison, up from the current two years.
Wildlife activists applauded the move, even as Hong Kong moves more slowly than Beijing. Mainland China banned ivory sales at the start of the year after shutting all carving factories and shops last March.

San Francisco 49ers Chief Executive Officer Jed York discussed firing head coach Chip Kelly and general manager Trent Baalke.York apologized to fans for the 2-14 season, and promised to help rebuild the 49ers culture."I am embarrassed. This is not acceptable to me," said York.When asked if he should be dismissed, York responded in part: "I own this football team. You don't dismiss owners."York said he wished the firings of Baalke and Kelly had been cleaner."I didn't see the future going the right way and I didn't see us being able to reestablish that winning culture."Sacramento Bee 49ers reporter Matt Barrows is tweeting that the team has interviews lined up this weekend with Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, and Chris Ballard who's in the Chiefs front office.As for the firings, Baalke says he found out on Friday that he won't be returning. Kelly found out after yesterday's loss.This year's 49ers team ranks dead last in franchise history, matching their worst record ever at 2-14. Kelly had to deal with some big injuries this season, he was asked before being fired, if he would be surprised if the team let him go."I don't think anything surprises me. I live my life in vision not circumstances; I control what I can control. What we control is how we coach our players and what we do with them, if that's good enough that's good enough. If it's not good enough, so be it," said Kelly.Baalke is being blamed for depleting the team's roster, mainly because of poor drafting. A lot of fans feel, Baalke's firing was a long-time coming.to read more stories about the 49ers.

Bass are still holding tight to shallow cover. Blade baits and frogs over the top are producing. When the sun gets high, work tight to the edge of the cover and let the bait sit before moving it. Shaky head trick worms and wacky rigged trick worms are working. Chatter baits are a good bait also. Deep cover and trash piles are holding fish for the deep fishermen.
Crappie, bluegill and shellcrackers are holding close also. We have been catching all three working 1/16 and 3/32 ounce jigs with different colored bodies. Slow retrieve is working. There are also bedding shellcrackers on the flats. Wigglers are the bait there. You can locate these areas by the smell.
Catfish are beginning to load up with roe and will be under the pads soon. Cut bait on jugs or trot lines are getting a good mess for the table.
The days are getting hotter, so be sure and keep plenty of water and sunscreen while out. Be safe and wear your PFD. We do not need any more tragedies this year.

President Donald Trump entertained the idea of negotiating a new deal to block Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons Tuesday during a joint press conference with French President Emanuel Macron."There is a chance, and nobody what's I'm going to do on the 12th, although Mr. President, you have a pretty good idea, but we'll see," President Trump said, apparently teasing forward to an upcoming deadline as it relates to the United States' continued participation in the deal. "But we'll see also if I do what some people expect, whether or not it will be possible to do a new deal with solid foundations, because this is a deal with decayed foundations."The president further reiterated his belief that the current Iran nuclear deal , negotiated during the Obama administration, is a "bad deal" that is "falling down" and should have "never have been made."Trump also issued a direct warning against Iran: "If Iran threatens us if any way, they will pay a price like few countries have ever paid."But even as the president suggested an openness to exploring a new Iran deal, he also hedged that such a deal may not come to fruition."I think we will have a shot to be a much bigger deal, maybe not deal, but we'll know fairly soon," Trump said.While President Trump stopped short of directly committing to the possibility of pursuing a new deal, President Macron made clear that he desires to pursue a new agreement, which Macron agreed is not sufficient to restraining Iran long term."It's not a mystery, we did not have the same starting positions," said Macron. "I can say that we've had very frank discussion on that, just the two of us. You consider that the Iranian deal, the JCPOA, the one negotiated in 2015 with Iran is a bad deal. For a number of months I've been saying that this was not a sufficient deal but that it enabled us at least until 2025 to have some control over their nuclear activities. We, therefore, wish to work on a new deal with Iran."Macron outlined his main interests in continuing to block Iran's nuclear development through 2025, something the current deal already does, while working to ensure that objectives are carried out long-term, and also end ballistic activities in the region."France is not naive when it comes to Iran," said Macron. "But we do not repeat the mistakes of the past."
After a run of negative headlines, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt is headed to Capitol Hill this week for two congressional hearings, where his performance under tough questioning from Democrats and Republicans could play a role in his future in the administration.The hearings are about the EPA's budget, but they also offer lawmakers an opportunity to ask about other concerns including allegations that the agency has been misusing taxpayer dollars.The renewed wave of criticism directed at Pruitt followed a report by ABC News that he'd been living in a condo owned by the wife of a prominent lobbyist. Pressure grew after media reports showed Pruitt circumvented the White House to grant pay raises to several staffers. And there have been new questions about his spending on travel and an around-the-clock security detail."It's an important hearing for him particularly under the various clouds he's under at the moment," said Myron Ebell, the director of the Competitive Energy Institute's Center for Energy and the Environment, who led the Trump EPA transition team.Pruitt is also facing new headlines this week about a previously undisclosed meeting with the lobbyist, J. Steven Hart, in July of 2017 when he was living in a condo co-owned by Hart's wife, who's also a lobbyist, raising questions about previous statements both Hart and Pruitt have made about their dealings.The embattled agency chief, the former attorney general of Oklahoma, has denied wrongdoing.His spending and possible ethics violations are the subjects of 10 separate investigations, after the EPA's inspector general informed Congress last week that it would review his use of agency security for personal trips. In recent weeks, roughly 170 Democrats have called for his resignation, and he drew sharp comments from some Republicans, including four who joined in calls for his dismissal.Ahead of the hearings, Democrats have raised fresh questions about the agency's decision to spend more than $43,000 to install a "secure phone booth" and conduct a sweep for listening devices in Pruitt's office, claiming that EPA documents indicate that the sweep and booth did not meet government security standards."He's very articulate, he knows what his agenda is, so I don't think the questions about policy will be particularly challenging for him," Ebell said. "The questions about his personal conduct will be something Democrats will focus on."If there are more accusations that come out, he is vulnerable."Throughout, Pruitt has maintained public support from President Donald Trump . But the White House has launched its own review of his actions on granting raises to several top aides who moved with him from Oklahoma. Press secretary Sarah Sanders deflected several questions about Pruitt on Monday, and credited the agency chief's success in walking back regulations."We're reviewing some of those allegations," Sanders said. "However, Administrator Pruitt has done a good job of implementing the president's policies, particularly on deregulation, making the United States less energy-dependent, and becoming more energy-independent. Those are good things."Pruitt's travel has been a particularly sore spot with some in the White House. He made repeated trips to his home state of Oklahoma in his first few months as administrator. After the EPA's internal watchdog agreed to look into those trips in August and the president fired former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price for the cost of his travel the next month, questions about Pruitt's travel attracted even more attention.The EPA inspector general is also expected to release reports about Pruitt's official travel for all of 2017 and his security detail, which the agency says was increased to 24-7 protection in response to increased threats against Pruitt. Those inquiries are expected to look at Pruitt's frequent use of first-class flights recommended by his security detail and whether the agency followed all proper procedures.There are signs the lingering questions about his spending are wearing on Republicans.Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., chairman of the House Oversight Committee, has asked for documents and records regarding Pruitt's travel and security costs, and for interviews with at least five of Pruitt's top aides. That request came not long after top Democrats on the committee said they have reviewed internal EPA documents that question whether Pruitt's security detail exaggerated the threats against him to justify expenses like the first-class flights.In a recent interview with Fox News, Gowdy was skeptical of the EPA argument that Pruitt has flown first class on work trips because of security threats.Pruitt told reporters he would direct his staff to book him on more coach flights."The notion that I've got to fly first class because I don't want people to be mean to me, you need to go into another line of work if you don't want people to be mean to you. Like maybe a monk, where you don't come in contact with anyone," he said.Republican staff on the House Energy and Commerce Committee have also been in contact with the EPA regarding Pruitt's controversial spending."I certainly think he has a responsibility to answer significant questions that have been raised and I do not think he has done so," Rep. Leonard Lance, R-N.J., said.Kevin Chmielewski, Pruitt's former deputy chief of staff, has met with congressional investigators in the House and Senate, after claiming Pruitt retaliated against him for questioning his travel spending.On Friday, law firm Williams & Jensen indicated in a new filing that Hart lobbied the EPA in early 2018 on behalf of Smithfield Foods. Ryan Williams, a spokesman for Hart, said the lobbyist, along with former Smithfield vice president Dennis Treacy, met earlier with Pruitt -- in 2017 -- in a personal capacity.Hart and Smithfield Foods denied that any lobbying took place."I assisted a friend who served on the Chesapeake Bay Commission, and this is inaccurately being tied to Smithfield Foods. I was not paid for this assistance and any suggestion that I lobbied for Smithfield Foods is inaccurate," Hart said in a statement.A spokesman for Williams & Jensen said an "independent review of the firm's lobbying activity in advance of the quarterly filing deadline concluded that Mr. Hart had lobbying contact with the Environmental Protection Agency in the first quarter of 2018. The firm has filed the requisite disclosure forms required by law accordingly."The firm is in the process of reviewing its 2017 lobbying disclosures.

NEW DELHI (AP) — An Indian company that is partnering with the Trump Organization on an office tower project outside New Delhi has been accused of running an elaborate real estate swindle that cheated investors out of nearly $150 million.
Documents obtained by The Associated Press make no mention of the Trump Organization, and focus largely on two real estate deals that began years before the organization signed a 2016 agreement with IREO to partner on an office tower outside of New Delhi.
Ramesh Sanka, the former CEO of the real estate firm IREO, says he saw "various acts of cheating, fraud and misappropriation of money," creating "huge wrongful gains" for the company's managing director and his associates.
Top IREO officials could not be reached for comment.
Minister Miri Regev announces that her ministry will fund the security detail for Hapoel Be’er Sheva's upcoming game in Turkey.
Culture and Sport Minister Miri Regev (Likud) announced on Sunday night that her ministry will fund the security detail for the Hapoel Be’er Sheva soccer team’s upcoming game in Turkey against Besiktas.
"As recommended by the security agencies, security at a significant financial cost is required to secure the state champion Hapoel Be’er Sheva during its trip to Turkey," said Regev in a statement.
"I’ve instructed my ministry to pay for the extra security costs, given the recent sensitive security situation, and these costs will not be imposed on the team,” she continued.
The announcement follows Saturday night’s shooting attack in Istanbul, in which 39 people, including an Arab Israeli woman, were murdered.
The attack came three weeks after two explosions outside Besiktas’s home stadium in Istanbul killed 29 people and wounded 166.
Regev noted on Sunday night that many fans have been asking her whether they should fly to Turkey for the game, to be held in less than a month, due to the security situation.
"I'm asking the fans to behave according to the guidelines published by the Counter Terrorism Bureau,” she said.

PHOENIX (AP) — Rookie forward Josh Jackson matched his career best with 21 points, T.J. Warren added 20 and the Phoenix Suns snapped a five-game losing streak by beating Dallas 102-88 on Wednesday night, handing the Mavericks their fifth loss in a row and eighth in nine games.
Phoenix backup point guard Isaiah Canaan broke his left ankle in a gruesome injury late in the first quarter.
Marquese Chriss added 15 points and 12 rebounds for the Suns, who beat Dallas for the fourth time in a row dating to last season.
After missing Monday night's game in Memphis with bruised ribs, Devin Booker was back starting at point guard for Phoenix and scored 15 points.
Dennis Smith Jr. scored 17, Harrison Barnes 15 and Dirk Nowitzki 14 for the Mavericks, who shot just 36 percent.
Booker opened the game with a 3-pointer and Phoenix never relinquished the lead.
Danuel House made two 3s and Canaan and Jared Dudley one apiece in a 12-2 run that put the Suns up 35-14 with 23 seconds left in the first quarter.
The Mavericks cut it to single digits twice, once to eight points and once to nine, in the second quarter and were down 57-46 at halftime.
Phoenix dominated the third period, leading 81-58 after Troy Daniels' 3-pointer with 2:20 left.
The Mavericks cut it to 91-84 on Smith's 3-pointer with 3:17 to go but Booker responded with a three-point play to put Phoenix up 94-84. Dallas never got it to single digits again.
Canaan was driving to the basket when he was fouled by Wesley Matthews with three seconds left in the first quarter. Canaan's ankle gave way on a hard, awkward landing, and his left foot was pointing in the wrong direction as his body tumbled to the floor.
As trainers rushed to Canaan, there were groans from the crowd and looks of shock from his Phoenix teammates, some of whom covered their eyes or looked away.
He was sitting up as he was rolled out of the arena on a stretcher.
Canaan, in his fifth NBA season, was signed Dec. 13 after being waived by Houston in October.
TIP-INS
Mavericks: Matthews shot 2 of 17. ... Nowitzki played 27 minutes and is 32 shy of becoming the sixth player in NBA history to play 50,000 minutes in the regular season. ... Nowitzki's 1,462 career points in 70 regular-season games against Phoenix are fifth-most by any player against the Suns in their history.
Suns: The 88 points scored by Dallas matched a season low for a Phoenix opponent. ... The four-game winning streak over Dallas is the Suns' longest against the Mavs since winning nine in a row from 1997-99. ... Chriss missed the previous game with a sprained ankle. ... The Suns set the NBA record on Monday in Memphis with a 3-pointer in their 1,109th consecutive game and made it 1,110 on Wednesday. Dallas previously held the record of 1,108.

ISLAMABAD (AP) — Sarfraz Ahmed's Pakistan team had the lowest ranking entering the Champions Trophy, and was pilloried after a disappointing opening loss that had critics suggesting it couldn't advance beyond the group stage.
A sequence of three straight wins, including a semifinal victory over a confident host, means Pakistan is the first team to qualify for Sunday's final. And now that they're in it, Pakistan fans want a rematch against India.
Imran Khan, the legendary allrounder who guided Pakistan to victory in the 1992 World Cup final, forecast an Indo-Pak final even before India's semifinal match against Bangladesh.
"Now the whole nation awaits our team making amends in the final against India — if they defeat Bangladesh," Khan posted on Twitter as he congratulated Pakistan on its semifinal win over England.
Pakistan was thrashed by 124 runs by defending champion India in the first group match in the eight-team tournament but rebounded quickly to beat South Africa and Sri Lanka to qualify for its third Champions Trophy semifinals.
Sarfraz Ahmed, seemingly lost for words after the heavy loss to India, maintained faith in the younger players in the squad and it paid off in one of the most lopsided semifinals in the tournament's history.
The eight-wicket victory at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff was made possible with the likes of fast bowler Hasan Ali, opening batsman Fakhar Zaman and young spinner Shadab Khan.
Ali, who conceded 70 runs against India, is now a leading bowler in the tournament with 10 wickets. Zaman has provided Pakistan some electrifying starts. And Shadab's ability to control big hitters in the middle overs has helped Pakistan restrict the scoring of opponents.
"The turnaround is built on the inclusion of youngsters and it could only be done by a Pakistan team," said Ramiz Raja, an ex-Pakistan captain who now works at a cricket commentator. "The tournament is no more about the rankings, because already No. 8 team is in the final."
Pakistan, which can be shaky when batting second, has successfully chased down in three successive matches that included Ahmed's gritty half century against Sri Lanka after Pakistan had collapsed to 162-7 while chasing 237-run target.
Pakistan's more seasoned players like Shoaib Malik and Mohammad Hafeez are yet to fire in the tournament and have so far been overshadowed by the young performers.
Imran Khan is hopeful that the squad of 2017 can achieve a victory during the holy month of Ramadan, much like his squad did 25 years ago.
A resident of Herzliya was arrested yesterday because of a US request to extradite him to her on suspicion of murdering his mother.
He allegedly drugged his mother with a sleeping drug and stabbed her to death in her car.
The suspect, Thomas Joseph Gross, will be brought to the Jerusalem District Court for a remand hearing tomorrow.

When George Miller, the director of the renowned post-apocalyptic film Mad Max, gives his blessing for his decades-old release to be screened without dialogue and shown accompanied by a live re-score, you know his sensibilities must align with those who are creating the music to support it.
And that is exactly what will happen via an ensemble of musicians who have made scoring for cult cinema classics in live settings their passion. Spearheaded by zealous New York-based cinefile and musician Devon E. Levins, the outfit, Morricone Youth will visit Australia next month as part of Sydney Festival, touching down to perform live score soundtracks for enhancement of screenings of two iconic films. The 1968 George A. Romero directed Night of the Living Dead and 1979, Australian original– Mad Max.
The latter will screen somewhat fittingly on Australia Day (26th January) and according to Levins, George Miller in most of his early interviews, confesses he conceived the film to be silent– the dialogue, the car screeching and the bells and whistles were all added bonuses to his vision.
“We’re kind of taking him to task, and he’s allowing us to do it. So it’s a little bit of that, and we wanted to do the silent film stuff that we do, a little bit of the Western and then we’ll have a lot of action high-octane, car chase music at times.” Levins, painting the picture as to what audiences can expect from the scored screen performance.
To truly comprehend the gravitational pull of reinterpreting cult film soundtracks, understanding a little of Levin’s history is useful.
The genesis of Morricone Youth occurred predating 1999, before he had relocated to the East Coast. From his base in San Diego he’d enjoyed notoriety in the post punk-rock band scene from age 13. Acts including Rocket from the Crypt and Pinback were part of his band community, and it took both his membership to the band Creedle (an act who erred on the side of comic-book geeky and who used the tropes of tv and film and other pop cultural references to sample within their music) and an idea he shared with a fellow band bass player to reinterpret soundtracks to films that they loved, for Levins to birth what is now recognised as Morricone Youth.
“When I got to New York, I found some like-minded people and film soundtrack fans, and started it [the band]as a side project. We all had our sort of indie projects or side projects we were working on and this band started getting better gigs rather than the other ones we were in. I guess because there was something thematic about it, or it was an easy thing to sell to get into clubs or whatever.”
The MO (modus operandi) for the show and the band is that it’s music written for the moving image. That can mean film music, tv music, video installation music as well as incorporating library production music which has emerged as yet another of Levin’s passions – more on that later.
“We had a catalogue of 150 songs, that we had reinterpreted from the 60s 70s 80s and from there we just sort of did this album all over the place. It was for this imaginary film and it had a lot of genres on it but we sort of thought we should get a bit more thematic with each one. We thought perhaps maybe a Western, maybe an Italian horror– Giallo, or even a spy movie.” Says Levin.
Adding: “We started covering songs, but we wouldn’t just cover songs that had appeared in movies, we were more interested in songs specifically written for films and scenes that were visual in nature.”
Naturally the group started working closely with a theatre in Brooklyn to do live scores to silent films or midnight films and Levins recollects that the first one, was the French Horror film: Fascination directed by Jean Rollin. A 70s cinematic release which he admits he’d initially had reservations of rewriting music for, especially as it was a more modern film.
“We did it with the dialogue and the sound off, kind of like an old silent film. And it did really well, so we started rotating between silent films and midnight movies.”
To say there is an increasing interest for this type of show around the world is probably an accurate statement. Levins can’t quite pinpoint where the resurgence has originated but certainly it feels to him that this experiential form of cinema and soundscape is on the rise among audiences.
“I don’t know if it’s a huge thing or not, but it’s a niche– every city /at least major city in the United States, I’m finding is starting to do this kind of thing and I do feel like it’s the Wild West a little bit. I think there is something happening around the rise of the Internet. Nothing is really a secret anymore, people are saying what’s going on in Alamo in Austin; in Cinefamily in LA; and they have a lot going on in LA quite often where they’re doing these live scoring events, and I think they’re influenced by these bigger live scoring events and New York and I’m assuming all over the place – London and you’re noticing it from Australia too”
In fact at the time of speaking with Cyclic, Morricone Youth, are finishing up a support slot tour with Italian soundtrack outfit: Goblin, a band revered in this niche and who Levins mentions have somewhat miraculously reformed after a period on hiatus. He also shares that on this tour, it’s not uncommon for fellow Italian composer Fabio Frizzi to be performing days ahead of them with his eight piece orchestra. Levins adds that one of his idols, composer John Carpenter is also currently on tour.
“He’s coming to New York, and I mean our last show of this tour is next Sunday at Irving plaza and four days later is John Carpenter with his six or seven piece band with visuals. And John Carpenter is drawing a lot more than say our band, because these are all things that people never thought (me included) that we would see. Goblin reform, Fabio Frizzi performing live (cos he’s just an Italian Composer) or, I mean I’d never in my wildest dreams, would think that John Carpenter would be touring musically, it doesn’t even register. It doesn’t make any sense and he’s selling out and playing big festivals in Europe, I don’t know that he’s made it to Australia yet. So there is something going on.”
And it’s this sort of passion for the industry he resides within that has seen Levins dovetail from live score performance into hosting a highly successful radio show, dedicated to unearthing composers and revealing library production rarities he’s laboured to find over the years. While it continues to be a dream of Levins to interview the likes of John Carpenter, he’s content with the composer lineage he’s rubbed shoulders with so far, which extends to Australian composer, Sven Liebeck. (see our interview with Sven here)
“I think the younger composers appreciate it because they have a place where they can have their music played and talk about it and I always try to not just keep it to my dream composers that I’m chasing. Yes, I’m going after John Carpenter don’t get me wrong, but I like to get those composers who on their first or one off and I get promo-’d so many records I try to listen to them.”
And as the five piece (none of whom have ever visited Australian shores) prepare for their new year trip down under, we touch once more on what audiences can look forward to experiencing musically from the two performances.
Night of the Living Dead will feature a customised DCP – where the sound goes up and down and the key dialogue from the film remains, because Levins states, that they really didn’t want to step on it too much.
“There is famous lines and if you’re familiar with the film there is ‘so called’ tv reporting and it doesn’t make any sense for a band to be playing on top of that or whatever so we kind of sit out at times.
Where as Mad Max the next night, it’s pretty synth heavy. The film was created in 1979 that was a time when synthesizers were being more heavily used in ‘B movies’ and action movies so we kind of approached it that way.”
Night Of The Living Dead and Mad Max with live score by Morricone Youth is a part of Sydney Festival 25 & 26 January 2018.
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal copyright board has raised the music streaming royalties for songwriters and music publishers by more than 40 percent to narrow the financial divide separating them from recording labels.
The decision announced earlier this weekend by the National Music Publishers Association stems from a dispute pitting songwriters against steadily growing music streaming services sold by Spotify, Apple, Google, Amazon and Pandora.
The Copyright Royalty Board's decision will require those services to pay 15.1 percent of their revenue to the songwriters and publishers, up from 10.5 percent.
The music publishers association hailed the ruling, even though the trade group estimates recording labels will still be receiving $3.82 for every $1 paid to songwriters and publishers. Even so, that still represents "the most favorable balance in the history of the industry," said David Israelite, president of the music publishers association.
None of the major companies affected by the new music streaming royalties responded to requests by The Associated Press for comment, leaving it unclear whether the shift will prod any of them to raise the prices paid by consumers.
The popularity of music streaming services has soared in the past few years as more consumers have embraced paying a monthly or annual subscription fee for unlimited access to tens of millions of songs instead of incrementally buying a more limited amount of music on CDs or in a digital download.
Those changing habits have pushed artists, songwriters and publishers to step up their efforts to get a larger cut of the royalties generated from music streaming — a format that didn't even exist when some performers signed their last record deals years ago.
The Copyright Royalty Board drew up the new rates for songwriters and publishers after hearing evidence during a trial last year.
"Songwriters desperately need and deserve the rate increases," said Bart Herbison, executive director for the Nashville Songwriters Association International, another trade group.
The new royalties seem unlikely to faze Apple, Google and Amazon — all of whom rank among the world's richest companies and operate their music streaming services as complements to other products that generate most of their revenue.
The new royalty systems could leave a bigger financial dent in smaller and less diversified companies such as Spotify and Pandora, even though both are music streaming pioneers.

The Trump Administration is giving insurance companies an extra three weeks to decide whether to offer insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act markets, and how much to charge.
The extension comes as insurance companies wait for Trump to decide whether he will continue to make payments to insurance companies that are called for under the Affordable Care Act, but that some Republicans have opposed.
The payments – known as cost-sharing reduction payments – reimburse insurance companies for discounts on copayments and deductibles that they're required by law to offer to low-income customers. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the payments this year would be about $7 billion.
Trump has said he may end the reimbursements, which he calls "bailouts," and has been leaving insurers to wonder month-to-month about whether they will receive a check.
A White House spokesman says Trump is "working with his staff and his cabinet to consider the issues raised by the CSR payments."
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services says it's offering the extra time so insurance companies can plan ahead in case the government decides to end the payments. In a memo Friday, the agency said many states are now requiring companies to file their rates for 2018 on the assumption that they won't be reimbursed.
Several companies say that without the cost-sharing payments, their rates will see double-digit increases. For example, Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina says ending the payments would push its rates up 14.1 percent.
The HHS memo says "there have been no changes regarding HHS's ability to make cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers."
But it then says the agency intends to change the ACA's risk adjustment program to compensate for the loss of cost-sharing payments.
The changes are technical and complex, but Timothy Jost, professor emeritus at Washington & Lee University's law school, says in a Health Affairs blog that the memo just deepens the confusion.
"We still do not know if all of this is needed or not — the Trump administration has not made up its mind," he says.
The cost-sharing payments have been at the center of a political battle over the Affordable Care Act since before President Trump took office.
House Republicans opposed to the health law sued then-President Obama, saying the payments are illegal because Congress hadn't appropriated money for them. A judge agreed but allowed the administration to continue making the payments during an appeal.
Now that Trump is in the White House, and Republican efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act have failed, many Republicans are urging the president to continue the payments rather than undermine the health care markets.
The 12 boys and their soccer coach who remain trapped inside a partly flooded cave in northern Thailand appeared healthy and upbeat in new video released Wednesday morning.The footage, taken by the Royal Thai Navy on Tuesday and posted to Facebook , shows the boys and their coach wrapped in foil blankets and sitting clustered together in the dark cave, alongside divers and medics who have been looking after the group since locating them. A flashlight illuminates the boys' thin but smiling faces as they take turns talking on camera, each introducing themselves, saying they're in good health and showing signs of gratitude.Meanwhile, rescuers are frantically trying to come up with a plan to extract the boys from the depths of the cave as safely, and quickly, as possible.The teammates, between the ages of 11 and 16, hiked into Tham Luang Nang Non, Thailand's longest cave, with their 25-year-old soccer coach after practice on June 23. It's believed that the coach often brought his team to the popular tourist site in mountainous Chiang Rai province for fun excursions.But as the group ventured deeper into the complex, the sky opened up and it began to rain, flooding the cave and cutting off their exit route. The group forged ahead before finding a raised, dry chamber where they were stranded in total darkness.Thai officials launched a massive search and rescue operation involving more than 1,000 people, including specialists drafted in from various nations such as Australia, China, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. The search and rescue teams tried anything they could to locate the boys and their coach -- deploying ultrasonic sensors into the cave, drilling through the rock and dropping survival packages down holes they found above ground in hopes the shafts connect to the cave network below.After more than a week, two British cave divers found all 13 alive in an area of the cave that's about half a mile underground and more than a mile from the main entrance. But the trek there was treacherous and took about six hours on Monday.The divers, John Volanthen and Richard Stanton, had to navigate through a labyrinth of caverns and tunnels, both dry and flooded, with some barely wide enough for their diving equipment."They are cave divers with experience of diving in very flooded caves all over the world and some rescue operations as well," Bill Whitehouse, the vice chairman of the British Cave Rescue Council, told ABC News of Volanthen and Stanton. "They had skills to go in through the flooded passages and lay a guideline for others to follow and clear obstructions to allow people to get through. So, they were the pathfinders."Volanthen and Stanton, who are members of the British Cave Council, described to colleagues the challenging hazards within the cave, including poor visibility, powerful currents in the floodwaters, extremely narrow passageways and one flooded area they said was about 5,000 feet long, half of which had no airspace to emerge if something when awry underwater."It's not like open water diving where you can just surface if something goes wrong," Whitehouse said. "If you have gone 200 meters down a flooded cave passing, if anything wrong you have to come out that 200 meters before you can put your head up above water."While they were in relatively good shape, some of the boys complained of being weak from stress and lack of food while others suffered from minor injuries, such as scrapes and cuts. They have received high-protein drinks and medical assessments by the group of seven Royal Thai Navy members, a medical doctor and nurse who are staying with them."All 13 people are well," Royal Thai Navy commander Rear Adm. Arpakorn Yookongkaew told reporters Tuesday. "We have given the boys food, starting with easily digested and high-powered food with enough minerals."Thai officials are also working to run a fiber optic phone line into the cave so the boys can speak with their families waiting anxiously outside.It's unclear exactly how and when rescuers will extract the group, and Thai officials have cautioned that it could take "weeks or months."Crews have been scouring the region's rugged jungle-covered terrain in hopes of finding a safer way to enter the cave complex underground. They've also attempted to pump water from the flooded areas of the cave, but persistent downpours have hampered their efforts as Thailand enters its rainy season.Thai officials said the boys have been wearing diving masks and practicing breathing, in case heavy rains forecast for this weekend force the group to swim and dive out the same way rescuers entered."We need to be careful not to rush; as long as they are safe and strong, then they are in good hands," Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan Ocha told reporters Tuesday. "We can now reach and communicate with them so they are in our sights."

The Ball family’s off-court whims are starting to affect the fortunes of LiAngelo and LaMelo Ball on the court at Prienu Vytautas. After spending much of the previous week on vacation in Barcelona, Melo missed Monday’s 82-79 loss at Alytaus Dzukija with an illness while Gelo came off the bench and sat during most of his club’s crunch-time run.
BC Vytautas nearly completed a 20-point comeback with the help of a 19-6 fourth-quarter spurt, propelled by an all-Lithuanian lineup. After the game, head coach Virginijus Seskus suggested the shift in tactics was spurred on by the Balls’ absence from practice during their Spanish excursion.
“We had an abnormal situation,” Seskus explained, according to a translation. “They went to Spain for five days, Gelo with his parents, and they were not at practice. I gave Gelo 26 minutes today, which I think is fair according to the situation.
“My team is a team. They were getting ready all week. But things are the way they are. What can you do?”
If you’re in Seskus’ shoes you can begin by doing what he did: benching one of the brothers at the start and for most of the finish.
That Big Baller-imposed double standard wasn’t all that seemed to rankle Seskus in this case. He wasn’t pleased with the selfish, single-minded play he saw from Gelo amid a 14-point (6-of-13 from the field, 2-of-4 from three), six-rebound, zero-assist performance from the 19-year-old.
“We did not give a free Gelo the ball a couple of times,” Seskus admitted. “Gelo then drove the ball forward too far alone.”
With smarter play and greater participation in practice, LiAngelo should be able himself back into the coach’s good graces. It’s tough not to wonder, though, whether the family’s own designs—including the pursuit of more interesting content for Facebook’s “Ball in the Family”—might be infringing on the kids’ abilities to succeed as professional basketball players overseas.
HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong police have sealed off part of a busy downtown neighborhood after an unexploded bomb was found during construction work in the Asian financial center.
A police spokesman said Wednesday explosive ordinance disposal officers have been deployed to the scene in the city's Wan Chai district.
He did not give his name, as is customary under department rules.
Police diverted traffic, while shops and offices in surrounding towers were shuttered for the rest of the day and ferry service at a nearby pier was halted.
It's the second time in less than a week that a bomb has been unearthed at the site for a cross-harbor commuter rail link.
On Sunday, police defused a 1,000-pound (454-kilogram) bomb believed to be a U.S.-made device dropped during the World War II.
'America has no better friend than Israel,' says Netanyahu. 'Israelis are grateful for American independence.'
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu praised President Donald Trump and touted the close relations between Israel and the United States at a special Fourth of July celebration.
The event was held in a hall just outside of Ben Gurion Airport in Lod Tuesday night on the eve of America’s 242nd Independence Day.
United States Ambassador to Israel David Friedman and his wife Tammy hosted the event, which was attended by the prime minister and his wife, Sara Netanyahu.
In his address during the celebration, Prime Minister Netanyahu said that recent events highlighted the importance of America’s independence, and its role as leader of the free world. Netanyahu praised the US – and President Trump – for the recent embassy move, and the decision to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, better known as the Iran nuclear deal.
"It's a wonderful celebration - the 4th of July – anytime,” said Netanyahu. “But this year it is special. One year: President Trump moved the embassy after he declared Jerusalem Israel's capital. In the UN, a powerful defense of Israel, day in, day out. And you remember that Iran nuclear deal? Remember that? President Trump decided to leave this bad deal, and he did the greatest thing for the security of the world, and for the security of Israel."
The Prime Minister then chided European leaders over their continued support for the JCPOA, as well as efforts to strengthen the arrangement in the face of American opposition and renewed sanctions on Iran.
"This week there's going to be a meeting... in Europe. There's a meeting this week of the P-4 without the United States. They're going to discuss how to go around the decision President Donald Trump and the United States made to leave this deal which is funding Iran's terrorism and its aggression with billions of dollars.
"Stop appeasing Iran. This is what President Trump has said. But he's gone well beyond saying it. It is what he's doing. We in Israel can appreciate this. We're grateful for America's independence. We're grateful for America's strength. We're grateful for America's alliance with Israel.
"We have relations with 160 countries, and some of these are terrific friends. But there is no friendship like the friendship between Israel and the United States of America. America has no greater friend than Israel, Israel has no greater friend than America."

New York (AP) — Petroleum futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange Monday:

The car was in autonomous mode with an operator behind the wheel
An Uber self-driving car has hit and killed a woman crossing the street in Arizona, marking the first fatality caused by an autonomous vehicle and a potential blow to the technology expected to transform transportation.
The ride services company said it was suspending North American tests of its self-driving vehicles, which are currently going on in Arizona, Pittsburgh and Toronto.
So-called robot cars, when fully developed by companies including Uber, Alphabet Inc and General Motors Co, are expected to drastically cut down on motor vehicle fatalities and create billion-dollar businesses. But Monday's accident underscored the possible challenges ahead for the promising technology as the cars confront real-world situations involving real people.
U.S. lawmakers have been debating legislation that would speed introduction of self-driving cars.
"This tragic accident underscores why we need to be exceptionally cautious when testing and deploying autonomous vehicle technologies on public roads," said Democratic Senator Edward Markey, a member of the transportation committee, in a statement.
Elaine Herzberg, 49, was walking outside the crosswalk on a four-lane road in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe about 10 p.m. MST Sunday (0400 GMT Monday) when she was struck by the Uber vehicle, police said. The car was in autonomous mode with an operator behind the wheel.
Herzberg later died from her injuries in a hospital, police said.
Local television footage of the scene showed a crumpled bike and a Volvo XC90 SUV with a smashed-in front. It was unknown whether Herzberg was on foot or on a bike.
Volvo, the Swedish car brand owned by China's Geely, confirmed its vehicle was involved in the crash but said the software controlling the SUV was not its own.
U.S. federal safety regulators were sending teams to investigate the crash. Canada's transportation ministry in Ontario, where Uber conducts testing, also said it was reviewing the accident.
Wild west
Uber and Waymo on Friday urged Congress to pass sweeping legislation to speed the introduction of self-driving cars into the United States. Some congressional Democrats have blocked the legislation over safety concerns, and Monday's fatality could hamper passage of the bill, congressional aides said Monday.
Safety advocates called for a national moratorium on all robot car testing on public roads.
"Arizona has been the wild west of robot car testing with virtually no regulations in place," said Consumer Watchdog, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, in a statement. "That's why Uber and Waymo test there. When there's no sheriff in town, people get killed."
Arizona has opened its arms to companies testing self-driving vehicles as a means to economic growth and jobs. Republican Governor Doug Ducey reached out to Uber in 2016 after California regulators cracked down on the company over its failure to obtain testing permits.
Self-driving cars being tested routinely get into fender-benders with other vehicles. Last week, a self-driving Uber crashed with another vehicle in Pittsburgh, local news reported. There were no injuries.
A year ago, Uber temporarily grounded its self-driving cars for a few days following a crash with another car in Tempe. The company has been the subject of a number of complaints about its autonomous vehicles, but the company has said the cars were being driven by a human driver at the time of the incidents.
Essential to Uber's success
Uber has said its ability to build autonomous cars is essential to its success in the rapidly changing transportation industry. The company envisions a network of autonomous cars that would be summoned through the Uber app that would supplement - and eventually replace - human-driven cars.
Uber has logged 2 million self-driving miles (3.2 million km) through December. The company has more than 100 autonomous cars testing on the roads of the greater Phoenix area, the company's prime testing ground due to the state's loose regulations and hospitable weather. Rain, snow and ice are particularly challenging for autonomous cars. The company also tests in Pittsburgh and Toronto.
Concerns over the safety of autonomous vehicles flared after a July 2016 fatality involving a Tesla Inc automobile with a partially autonomous system that required human supervision. Safety regulators later determined Tesla was not at fault.
Uber has weathered a series of crises, including sexual harassment claims, using a tracking tool to avoid government officials, and a lawsuit brought by competitor Waymo alleging theft of self-driving trade secrets. Uber settled that lawsuit last month for US$245 million.
That settlement was largely seen as a means for Uber to resume work on autonomous cars without the distraction of litigation, as it hustles to catch up with Waymo, widely seen as having the most advanced cars in the industry.

ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Authorities on the Greek island of Lesbos say they have blocked a ship carrying container homes for refugees and other migrants in protest at the refusal of the government and the European Union to move more people to Greece's mainland.
A government-chartered ship carrying the containers remained anchored at the island's main town Monday after municipal vehicles were used to block port facilities. The island's municipal board was due to meet later Monday to decide on whether to lift the blockade following talks with the government, state-run TV said.
The mayors of five Greek islands facing the coast of Turkey are demanding that the government and EU end a policy of containment for migrants — introduced last year as a deterrent against illegal migration — because living facilities are severely overcrowded.

When Megan Olson lands in South Korea for the Winter Olympics next week, she'll feel something that is both surreal and vivid.
An intoxicating sense of belonging.
A deep sense of loss.
Pride, for the motherland she barely knows after being secretly adopted away.
The 33-year-old social worker from Minnesota is joining dozens of fellow South Korean adoptees who are returning to their birth country for the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang.
Many endured cultural, racial and national identity issues stemming from an international adoption phenomenon that peaked in the 1980s. Now, the once-in-a-lifetime Olympics experience will satisfy an internal pressure for some adoptees to justify being where they came from, even though it won't erase the fact that they were once sent away with shame and en masse.
"I think I really wanted to go back. It feels like it's home but at the same time, when I get there, I'm not home. I don't really know where I belong," Olson said.
The Olympics will also reconcile a part of their life journey that has been book-ended by an era of complete economic transformation for South Korea.
Much of that rise happened at the same time the small Asian country, lacking a solid social welfare system, dispersed an estimated 200,000 of its Korean-born children, according to Richard Lee, a University of Minnesota professor who studies adoptees.
The cultural diaspora reaches more than a dozen countries around the globe, including in western Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. But for South Korea, the timing of the adoption boom coinciding with their costly 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul is still a subject of criticism among some.
No longer in the shadows of the devastating Korean War era, the country over the past half century has become a powerhouse on the world stage, thanks to its fortunes in tech, cultural reach from pop music, and famously rigorous education system.
All the while, a majority of those South Korean orphans landed in the U.S. They grew up largely with white parents in the western world where adoption is seen as a humanitarian endeavor. Now adults, they've come of age and some have risen in the worlds of politics, fashion and entertainment.
That such orphans are now successful enough to afford an elite experience like the Olympic Games has surprised some of the locals in a patriarchal society where adoption is taboo.
Keziah Park of the International Korean Adoptee Service called it a "slap in the face" for status-driven South Koreans. The Seoul-based nonprofit since the 1990s has organized trips and birth-search pilgrimages for adoptees.
"When they left, they were orphans and they were abandoned. No could take care of them. But when they come back, it's a symbolic journey to Koreans observing them," Park said.
She added: "It really changes the mindset of Koreans. It allows Korea as a society to reflect on the choices they made."
The pressure to justify being there can also be distressing if they have already gone back to find their birth stories as a practical matter: to learn about their genetic health, or find out what happened to them as young children. And even if their adoptive families are supportive of their pilgrimage back, it can be difficult to reconcile their identity and feelings for the country when they lack Korean family ties.
Park organized the week-long Olympics tourism trip hoping to ease that internal conflict. It will include the opening ceremony and sporting events. They're also hoping to meet Marissa Brandt, an adoptee raised in America who will play for the Korean women's hockey team.
"Although they have an intrinsic purpose to be there, they don't have anyone welcoming them to be there, so they felt it was meaningless," Park said. "That purpose to be there, the adoptees want more than you think."
More than two dozen adoptees are expected on the trip, including those now living in Norway, Denmark, Italy, France, Australia and the U.S.
Olson, of Robbinsdale, Minnesota, said she thinks about going back to South Korea so often that it can wear on her husband. But each time she's there, she asks herself if it should be the last visit because it's so emotionally draining.
Olson found her birth parents a few years ago through their adoption agency in Seoul. Their meetings have left her distraught, frustrated and unfulfilled. Olson's desperate to understand her true life story but her Korean parents appear indifferent.
She says she was adopted in 1985 as a baby but discovered that they kept a son born a year after Olson. The adoptee doesn't know why her birth parents made those choices. They've only confirmed that she's a secret they'll never tell their other children.
But this upcoming trip to South Korea will offer a welcome reprieve to Olson's heartaches.
It will be about connecting with fellow adoptees who share this profound experience that they didn't choose to have.
It will be about eating the food that's been missing their whole lives, yet tastes so much like home.
It will be about experiencing the glitz and glam of The Olympic Games, though even that is not without fraught.
"I don't know who I would cheer for. Should it be the U.S.? Should it be Korea? It's super minute but something I think about," Olson said.
Ella and Tony LeVeque are two other adoptees who found the Olympics to be the perfect reason to go back to their birth country. The couple met at another adoptee gathering in Seoul before marrying in 2014.
"We obviously really like watching the Olympics. We tally up America versus Canada," said Ella LeVeque, a 31-year-old recruiter who was adopted as a baby to Ottawa, Canada. "And just being able to be there and represent South Korea, too, we're going to be able to be proud of all of it."
The two now live in Galesburg, Michigan. Neither has found their birth families.
Tony LeVeque, a 35-year-old hospital administrator, was adopted to central Michigan when he was 4 years old. He didn't feel much of a connection as a child when his adoptive parents showed him recordings of the 1988 Games in Seoul. Like many others, he also struggled with his identity before connecting with his roots in adulthood.
"It's difficult trying to find your own way," he said of the Korean adoptee experience. "What type of man or woman am I supposed to be in America?"
Matt Galbraith, 36, of Hawaii, said he'll spend time with his birth family after the Olympic events. He was adopted with his birth brother when he was 5 years old. They grew up in a happy home in the Phoenix area after enduring a dark year with unhappy memories at an orphanage in Munsan, near the Demilitarized Zone bordering North Korea.
Galbraith said he found his birth mother in 2009, taking a leap of faith by going to Seoul while he was stationed in Japan with the U.S. Navy. The woman asked Galbraith for forgiveness after a hotel worker helped reunite them.
He learned that the single mom put her boys up for adoption because she became infected with tuberculosis. Without money or support, she feared the worst and hoped her sons could have a better future that way.
"I was adopted when I was a little bit older. I remember having memories with them," Galbraith said of his birth family. "I knew that they were still there."

Jihadist group says one of its "soldiers" killed two policewomen and a student in Belgian city of Liege.
The Islamic State (ISIS) jihadist group on Wednesday claimed one of its "soldiers" killed two policewomen and a student in the Belgian city of Liege on Tuesday, AFP reported
The group made the claim on its Amaq propaganda agency.
"The author of the attack on the city of Liege in Belgium is a soldier of the Islamic State," the group had said in a statement published on Amaq's Telegram account.
ISIS said "he led the attack in response to calls to target the countries of the U.S.-led international coalition," which is fighting the terror group mainly in Syria.
The attacker, identified as Benjamin Herman, repeatedly stabbed two policewomen in Liege on Tuesday before using their own firearms to kill them, according to investigators in Belgium.
The 31-year-old also shot dead a student sitting in a parked car in the center of the industrial city.
Amateur footage of the attack obtained by AFP showed the gunman shouting "Allahu Akbar" as he walked through the streets during the rampage.
ISIS last year claimed a stabbing attack in Brussels, in which a 30-year-old Somalian man stabbed soldiers with a machete before being shot dead.
Brussels has been hit by several terrorist attacks in recent years. In June of 2017, an ISIS sympathizer set off a bomb at a Brussels Central Station.
In March 2016, terrorists affiliated with ISIS carried out a coordinated attack at Brussels Airport in Zaventem and Maalbeek metro station in the city, killing 32 people.

WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (AP) – William & Mary is investigating the defacement of a Thomas
Jefferson statue at the school after someone painted the hands red and wrote “slave owner”
nearby. University spokeswoman Suzanne Seurattan wrote in an email Tuesday that the school is
determining how to remove the paint without leaving damage. The statue is near the heart of the
Williamsburg campus. Seurattan wrote that the school encourages civil discourse but that “it is
never acceptable to deface property.”
LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) — Officials say the death toll from two days of heavy monsoon rains in eastern Pakistan has risen to 15.
The heaviest rains seen in Lahore since 1980 continued into Wednesday, flooding streets and causing some residents to join small demonstrations against local authorities.
Rescue officials and police confirmed the death toll, saying most deaths were caused by electrocution and homes caving in.
Pakistan has long struggled to cope with the annual monsoon rains, which trigger flash floods and mud slides that destroy homes.

NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) — Three people were killed and two injured when a helicopter crashed into a house in a suburban Southern California neighborhood just a few minutes after taking off, officials said.
The helicopter crashed into the house with such force that it was barely recognizable. The crushed metal sat in a heap on the side of the house, its tail rotor sticking out of the roof of a nearby home and a 6-foot chunk landing in the street in front of yet another house.
"All of a sudden the house just shook and I thought, 'Oh my gosh, we're having an earthquake,'" said Marian Michaels, who lives behind the home in a gated community in Newport Beach where the helicopter crashed.
Roger Johnson was doing some woodwork when he heard the chopping sound of a helicopter's rotating blades and then a tremendous boom across the street.
"I turned to look out of the garage and that's when I see this piece of metal flying through the air and hitting a bush and garage door," Johnson said. "Then I heard someone scream — a real for-real horror scream, like something terrible had happened."
Johnson rushed to the wreckage and cautioned people to stop trying to pull out or move victims.
Four people were aboard the Robinson R44 helicopter when it went down. All four were among those killed or injured, and one person who was on the ground but outside of the house was also injured, Newport Beach fire and police officials said. They did not say which was which, or give any specifics about the injuries.
Audrey Ellis, who lives next to the house where the crash happened, was not home at the time but said her neighbors told her they were in the kitchen when the helicopter hit the bedroom of their house.
"It's so scary," Ellis said, adding that her neighbors weren't hurt. "I'm so thankful."
The aircraft had taken off from John Wayne Airport, said Ian Gregor, a spokesman with the Federal Aviation Administration. The airport is about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from the crash site.
The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash.
Messages seeking comment from Revolution Aviation, which is based at the airport and operated the helicopter, were not immediately returned.
The company offers helicopter and airplane classes, the use of aircraft for photography and video production as well as sightseeing flights.
I was in the Alps skiing with my host family, the Otterbachs. This was my second time skiing. There is a huge difference between Mt. Kato skiing and alpine skiing. Markus, my host dad, was an expert teacher. I walked away with only fun memories and no broken bones thanks to his instruction. I’ve included a short video (https://goo.gl/8NFQW2) of myself slicing down the slopes. Like wind surfing on the North Sea, this was definitely one of the best highlights from my year as your Crailsheim ambassador.
Birthdays have been a big thing. It has seemed like every week someone I know has had a birthday and has celebrated it. I have been to a lot of birthday parties this year. My own was at the end of March. My friends had a nice backyard party for me. It was good to be outside on a pleasant spring day.
The theater is another thing that I enjoy. It has been fun to go to the theater with Elfriede Kohr. The movies we’ve settled on have been good, but the thing I secretly look forward to the most is a meal of kaesespaetzle. This is a delicious noodle with cheese meal that sometimes gets called the German macaroni and cheese. Calling it macaroni and cheese is sort of a disservice, so I am apologizing to my German friends who read this. Kaesespaetzle has by far been my favorite meal in Germany, and it has been a favorite of many exchange students in the past.
I have also been getting more into soccer. The weather has been warmer here than in Minnesota so we are spending more time outdoors. I play with school friends during our breaks. I have a lot to learn about being a better soccer player, but my teachers are patient with me even when I cost them a goal. I have also picked up watching soccer on TV. It has been fun to watch Bayern Munich. They have become my favorite team in the Bundesliga, the top German football league. My admiration of Munich has upset some of my friends who are Stuttgart fans. The friendly rivalry makes the game a lot more fun. It’s a lot like when Vikings fans and Packer fans sit in the same room to watch a game.
Another thing the Otterbachs have done for me is have me spend time with other families in Tiefenbach. I spent a day with the Keller family. They were the host family of Jaron and Skyla, They introduced me to sauerbraten, a delicious marinated roast. It is sometimes called the national dish of Germany. The Kellers then took me hiking near Crailsheim. On our trek we stopped to see a real blacksmith working in his shop. I enjoyed watching him work.
I am continually thankful to the Crailsheim Committee and all of its supporters for making these experiences possible. I would also like to wish everyone a happy Easter.

LONDON (AP) — A Cambridge University professor at the heart of the Facebook privacy scandal says that the former CEO of data firm Cambridge Analytica lied to a British parliamentary committee investigating fake news.
Academic Aleksandr Kogan's company, Global Science Research, developed a Facebook app that vacuumed up information from users as well as additional data from their Facebook friends.
Ex-employees of Cambridge Analytica say the company used that data from millions of users to help Donald Trump's 2016 presidential election campaign. The company denies the charge.
Kogan told Parliament's media committee Tuesday that Cambridge Analytica's ex-CEO, Alexander Nix, lied in his testimony on their work together.
When asked by committee chair Damian Collins about Nix's testimony that none of his data came from Global Science Research, Kogan said, "That's a fabrication."
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Stars react to the Golden Globe Award nominations announced Monday morning in Beverly Hills, California:
— "It was my morning to carpool, so I just dropped the kids off." — Laurie Metcalf, nominated for her supporting role in "Lady Bird," on her not-so-glamorous morning.
— "It's a good day when you wake up and find out that your show is on a list with 'Game of Thrones.'" — Dan Fogelman, creator of "This Is Us," nominated for TV drama series.
— "I'm descending into nonsensical happy words because I am not, I can't believe it, it's just amazing. It's just amazing." — Greta Gerwig, nominated for writing "Lady Bird," which she also directed.
— "I haven't started yet, but I've been looking at a bottle and it's staring me back." — Armie Hammer, on whether it's too early to start drinking Champagne to celebrate his supporting actor nod for "Call Me By Your Name."
— "We're having champagne for breakfast!" — Margot Robbie, a double nominee as producer and star of "I, Tonya."
— "This is a Chanukah miracle." - Pamela Adlon, up for actress in a TV comedy series for "Better Things."
— "We are, in a few hours, we are about to have our London premiere of 'Darkest Hour.' Tonight. So this is sort of a bit of frosting on the cake." — Gary Oldman, nominated for actor in a drama film for his portrayal of Winston Churchill.
— "Issa Rae is a hero of mine. I'm going to try not to stalk her at the Globes. I nearly died when I heard my name and hers in the same sentence. I'm dweebing out pretty hard." — Rachel Brosnahan of "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel," nominated alongside Rae for actress in a TV comedy series.

But it's really, really fabulous to have this happen on his birthday." — Richard Jenkins, a supporting actor nominee for "The Shape of Water."
The Delaware Department of Insurance (“DOI”) has received a proposed rate increase request from Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Delaware for a 33.6 percent rate hike for its 2018 individual Marketplace business.
This requested rate increase assumes that the cost-sharing subsidies and individual mandate will not be in place for 2018. Republicans in Congress are considering “repeal and replace” legislation for the Affordable Care Act.
Highmark BCBSD’s proposed rate will be studied by the InsuranceDepartmentand its independent actuaries before a final rate is determined.
In May, Aetna, Inc. (“Aetna”) announced its plans to withdraw from the Affordable Care Act’s (“ACA”) Insurance Marketplace effective January 1, 2018. This leaves Highmark BCBSD as the only health insurer to have filed products and rates for Delaware’s 2018 “Obamacare” market

This leaves Highmark BCBSD as the only health insurer to have filed products and rates for Delaware’s 2018 “Obamacare” market.
“Highmark’s proposed rate increase reflects the fact that the federal government could cut funding for the ACA by discontinuing cost-sharing reduction subsidies,” says Delaware Insurance Commissioner Trinidad Navarro. “Cost-sharing reduction subsidies are passed on to insurers to assist lower income individuals and families. In addition, it is unclear whether the ACA individual mandate will be enforced next year. If the Federal Government fails to live up to its obligations under the law, insurers will likely continue to exit the Marketplace.”
Individuals and families using Marketplace insurance are often self-employed or are nearing retirement age and/or have exhausted COBRA coverage from their former employer.
Approximately 27,000 Delawareans have health insurance through the Marketplace and will be affected by increasing rates and/or insurer withdrawals. The proposed rate increase will not apply to Delawareans on Medicaid or those with group or individual policies outside of the Marketplace.
“Without competition from other companies and with the Affordable Care Act’s fate left up to members of the federal government who appear to oppose it, we are in a difficult position. My job is to pursue premium fairness and increased competition. I will continue to work with Senators Carper and Coons and Congresswoman Blunt-Rochester’s offices to fight for the best interests of the people of Delaware,” added Navarro, a Democrat.
Twin Shadow, "Caer" (Warner Bros./Reprise)
For someone who was likely only in the first or second grade when the 1980s ended, George Lewis Jr. seems to have been powerfully affected by that decade's sonic landscape.
Lewis, whose stage name is Twin Shadow, has embraced drum machines, synths and the wild earnestness of '80s pop. It got away from him on his 2015 album "Eclipse," an over-the-top, slow burning collection of pure bombast.
Twin Shadow has toned it down on his new fourth album, "Caer," but it's never far, lurking. The album, titled after the Spanish word for "to fall," is always one flourish away from falling into disaster. It's a mixed bag but one that clearly shows growth and a way out of the shadows.
"Brace," featuring Rainsford, with its throwback spacy keyboard, is easily the album's outstanding track, a perfect collision of the songwriter's influences. It's rooted in the '80s but still sounds fresh, adding a guitar solo and name-checking Tom Petty.
"Saturdays," with the ladies from Haim stopping by to add their positively sunny sound, feels like it could play during the end credits of a John Hughes movie. It's a winner. But the flatulent "18 Years" ultimately fails, sounding like a cut that didn't make the "Say Anything" soundtrack.
The tender "Little Woman" gets overwhelmed by production elements, a frequent issue that pops up on "Caer." Many songs try too hard to be weighty and sound like they've been arranged for an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical.
The album's cover image is unintentionally apt. It shows someone covering their face with their hands, as if acknowledging they've wasted a chance. "I'm too mixed up," Twin Shadow warns us on the album, and you believe him.
Even the spare and pretty interlude "Twins Theme" is marred by clumsy rain sounds. And why halfway through "Obvious People" does the song warp and the vocals sped up, resembling Chipmunks?
Twin Shadow is listed as the producer or co-producer — as well as a mixer — on every song on the album. It might be time for him to relinquish some control or he's going to keep free falling like Tom Petty.

CAIRO (AP) — A top Egyptian rights lawyer says at least eight protesters were detained and accused of "association with a terrorist organization" after joining a small protest in Cairo over the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Khaled Ali says the protesters were arrested on Saturday in front of the Egyptian Press Syndicate in downtown Cairo after rallying against President Donald Trump's move.
It wasn't immediately possible to reach the prosecutors on Monday for a comment.
Ali says those detained, including a female activist, are accused of links to the Muslim Brotherhood group, Egypt's onetime largest Islamist group which was outlawed after the ouster of the Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in 2013.
Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi is a close ally of Trump, whose announcement triggered protests across the world.
WASHINGTON (AP) — The newest generation of the Kennedy political dynasty will be introduced to a national audience Tuesday night as he delivers the Democratic response to President Donald Trump's State of the Union.
Rep. Joe Kennedy III, a 37-year-old Massachusetts congressman and grandson of Robert F. Kennedy, says Democrats should focus on the economic worries of working-class voters who bolted the party in the 2016 elections.
To drive home the message, Kennedy will deliver his speech at a vocational high school in Fall River, Massachusetts, a gritty former textile hub 55 miles (89 kilometers) south of Boston.
"From health care to economic justice to civil rights, the Democratic agenda stands in powerful contrast to President Trump's broken promises to American families," Kennedy said in a statement, adding that his speech will be "guided by a simple belief that equality and economic dignity should be afforded to every American."
Kennedy, the red-haired son of former Rep. Joe Kennedy II, D-Mass., was elected to the House in 2012, returning the family to Congress two years after the retirement of Rhode Island Rep. Patrick Kennedy, who is the son of Joe Kennedy III's great-uncle Ted.
Besides his famous last name, Joe Kennedy III also is among a wave of younger Democrats in a caucus whose three top leaders are all in their 70s.
A former Peace Corps volunteer, Kennedy was an assistant district attorney in two Massachusetts districts before being elected to Congress. He has focused on economic and social justice in Congress and has advocated on behalf of vocational schools and community colleges and championed issues such as transgender rights and marriage equality.
To illustrate that message, Kennedy has invited Staff Sgt. Patricia King, a transgender infantry solider, to represent him at the State of the Union. King, an 18-year Army veteran, has twice been deployed to Afghanistan and has been awarded the Bronze Star.
House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi called Kennedy "a relentless fighter for working Americans" and said he "profoundly understands the challenges facing hard-working men and women across the country."
Matt Gorman, a spokesman for the campaign arm of House Republicans, could not conceal his glee as he welcomed the latest Kennedy as the voice of Democrats.
"Democrats using the multi-millionaire scion of a political dynasty as the face of their party shows they've learned absolutely nothing," Gorman said in an email, adding that the only way to give the GOP an easier target would be for Kennedy to make the speech "live from the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis," Massachusetts.
Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley said Kennedy will focus on education and the importance of preparing future generations for jobs while also pointing out "how Republicans fall short, and certainly the president."
Kennedy "will be talking to the forgotten men and women — the people the president says he is speaking to but since has shown he has little or no regard for," said Crowley, D-N.Y.
The speech is an opportunity for the three-term lawmaker to "step out a bit and make his own mark" in national politics, said Crowley, who recommended Kennedy for the role.
"He's young, talented and smart. He's got a great last name, but on his own, he's a wonderful man and that will come through as well," Crowley said. "The sky's the limit for him, frankly."
Before this speech, Kennedy's best-known moment was a 2017 speech criticizing House Speaker Paul Ryan for defending the GOP effort to repeal former President Barack Obama's health care law as "an act of mercy."
Kennedy called the GOP effort "an act of malice" in a late-night speech that was viewed millions of times on social media.
Kennedy's speech will be followed by a Spanish-language response delivered by Elizabeth Guzman, one of the first Latinas elected to the Virginia House of Delegates.

It’s been a whirlwind 24 hours for Roseanne Barr, whose hit show “Roseanne” was cancelled yesterday by ABC after the star’s racist tweet that was directed at Valerie Jarrett, a former aide of President Barack Obama.
Barr has since blamed her behavior on the sleep aid Ambien. The revelation came in a storm of tweets from Barr early Wednesday morning, which included responses to “Roseanne” cast members who tweeted out statements of their own after the cancelation. First, Michael Fishman, who played D.J. Connor on the show, tweeted that Tuesday’s chain of events made the day among the hardest in his life.
“I feel devastated, not for the end of the Roseanne show, but for all those who poured their hearts and souls into our jobs, and the audience that welcomed us into their homes. Our cast, crew, writers, and production staff strived for inclusiveness, with numerous storylines designed to reflect inclusiveness. The words of one person do not exemplify the thinking of all involved,” he wrote. “I condemn these statements vehemently. They are reprehensible and intolerable, contradicting my beliefs and outlook on life and society.”
He added: “We must standup against bias, hatred, bigotry and ignorance to make society a better place for all.”
That prompted Roseanne to accuse Fishman of throwing her under the bus. “I created the platform for that inclusivity and you know it. ME. You throw me under the bus. nice!” she wrote.
i created the platform for that inclusivity and you know https://t.co/hViHPX2ZUb. You throw me under the bus. nice! — Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) May 30, 2018
Minutes later, Barr responded to tweets from, Sara Gilbert, who portrayed Roseanne’s daughter, Darlene Connor. Gilbert posted earlier Tuesday, “Roseanne’s recent comments about Valerie Jarrett, and so much more, are abhorrent and do not reflect the beliefs of our cast and crew or anyone associated with our show. I am disappointed in her actions to say the least.”
Roseanne’s recent comments about Valerie Jarrett, and so much more, are abhorrent and do not reflect the beliefs of our cast and crew or anyone associated with our show. I am disappointed in her actions to say the least. — sara gilbert (@THEsaragilbert) May 29, 2018
This is incredibly sad and difficult for all of us, as we’ve created a show that we believe in, are proud of, and that audiences love— one that is separate and apart from the opinions and words of one cast member. — sara gilbert (@THEsaragilbert) May 29, 2018
Barr also seemed stunned by Gilbert’s admonition, writing, “Wow! unreal.” in response to Gilbert.
Wow! unreal. — Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) May 30, 2018
The actress did apologize via her Twitter account for the original tweet that set all of these events in motion yesterday and deleted the racist tweet. Earlier Wednesday, she attempted to explain that, “I’m not a racist, just an idiot who made a bad joke.”
Roseanne is definitely not off Twitter despite her statement yesterday that she was leaving it. And her “Ambien tweeting” line has users describing every odd (non-racist) thing they’ve done while on the sleep drug. @therealroseanne pic.twitter.com/VAEbSxYYbc — Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) May 30, 2018
After blaming Ambien for her behavior, the actress later deleted her references to the drug.
RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Brazil will play Russia in a friendly in March at the stadium that will host the World Cup final.
The Brazilian football confederation said on Tuesday that the friendly at the Luzhniki stadium in Moscow will be on March 23.
Brazil will face Germany four days later in its last friendly before coach Tite announces his final squad for the World Cup in June.
If Tite's team finishes top of its group, it will only play at the Luzhniki if it reaches the final.
In November, the stadium was reopened with Argentina beating Russia 1-0.
Brazil will play in Moscow against Serbia on June 27 in its last match in Group E, but that game will be at the Spartak Arena.
The Virginia School Boards Association (VSBA) has released its 21st Annual VSBA Showcases for Success Directory, highlighting successful K-12 programs in Virginia’s public schools. Appomattox County Public Schools is one of 56 school divisions from across the Commonwealth that has programs featured in the directory. Programs from Appomattox County Public Schools are the Nurse Aide Program and the Student Volunteer Exchange program. Appomattox County High School’s Nurse Aide Program consists of three years of study. The Student Volunteer Exchange Program was created by the Appomattox 1865 Foundation in partnership with the National Park Service and AP U.S. History classes at Appomattox County High School for the Sesquicentennial of Lee’s surrender.
The Supreme Court has given the state half a year to enforce the law against an illegal building supplies store and an illegal garage in the Samarian Palestinian Authority village of Luban Ash-Sharqiyah, near the Jewish community of Eli.
Orders against the businesses were first taken out in 2010.
NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — Police on Staten Island are looking for thieves who ransacked a family’s home.
They said the burglars targeted a woman while she was picking up her kids from school.
“I came out and looked around, didn’t notice anything suspicious and I just got in my truck and went to work, then my wife texted me there was a robbery two houses down and I just missed it,” Frank Stapleton said.
“And they just moved in. I feel bad for them. They’re new neighbors,” Pat Lavin told CBS2’s Jessica Moore.
The splintered door from on Craig Avenue in the Tottenville section told the story of a frightening midday crime targeting a young family.
Police say a woman was gone for only a few minutes Monday afternoon, to pick up her kids from school when she returned to find thieves had ransacked her house.
Cops said the thieves not only stole things, they stole memories, like earrings and the necklace the woman wore on her wedding day. They even took her husband’s wedding band.
Neighbors were astonished at the fast moving crooks who came and went with barely a trace.
“So now I’m putting a security door on my house,” Carmela Fazio said.
Fazio told CBS2’s Moore she’s in the neighborhood every day and never sees anything like this.
“I look up and down. The buses are constantly running, so you’d think nobody would try anything with the buses running, but you know, no fear,” she said.
Police don’t have much to go on, but are working hard to track them down.
The NYPD said there have been several other daytime burglaries in the Tottenville, area, but they don’t believe they are connected.
Sunday’s national average of $2.76 per gallon was the highest daily average since July 2015. Tennessee gas prices set a fresh new high of the year. Sunday’s state average of $2.55 was the highest since September, when prices recovered from hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
The average price in Tennessee was 3 cents more than a week ago and 37 cents more than the same time last year.
The most expensive gas price averages in Tennessee were in Kingsport-Bristol at $2.59, Morristown at $2.58 and Nashville at $2.57. The least expensive gas price averages in Tennessee were in Chattanooga at $2.48, Memphis at $2.51 at Clarksville-Hopkinsville at $2.52.
On Sunday, Tennessee ranked 11th among states with the lowest gas prices. It cost $38 to fill an average-sized tank of gasoline in Tennessee. Tennessee motorists paid $6 more for a full tank of gas, compared to the same time last year.
“High oil prices are the main reason gasoline is so expensive right now,” said Mark Jenkins, spokesman for AAA. “The price of oil is about 25 percent more than last year, as what used to be a global supply glut, is now tightening. Now, the added expense for oil is making it more expensive to produce gasoline. In addition, gasoline demand is strong, and inventories are down, as refineries wrap-up their maintenance season and begin pushing out summer-blend gasoline. So there are currently a number of factors keeping upward pressure on gas prices.
“If we haven’t already, gas prices will hit their annual peak within the next couple weeks. However, unforeseen circumstances like escalating geopolitical tensions or a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico would cause prices to surge. Unfortunately, oil prices could still remain elevated heading into the summer travel season. Which means, travelers will likely find the most expensive summer gas prices in four years.”
Oil prices were $15 per barrel higher than the same time last year. Half the price of gasoline was determined by the price of oil. Oil prices were higher than a year ago due to strong global demand and reduced supply glut.
Nationally, the highest average price for gasoline was April 22 at $2.76; the lowest was Jan. 3 at $2.49. In Tennessee, the highest average price was April 22 at $2.55; the lowest was Jan. 1 at $2.26.

CHICAGO (AP) — Investigators say communication problems between flight attendants and pilots put evacuating passengers at more risk after an American Airlines plane caught fire in 2016 at Chicago O'Hare International Airport.
The National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday that flight attendants didn't know how to use the intercom system to speak with pilots before they directed passengers to use an emergency exit behind an engine that was still running.
One passenger was hurt after being knocked to the ground by a jet blast from the engine.
The NTSB says the fire started when pieces of an engine disc broke off and pierced a fuel line with such force that one piece was found a half mile away. The board recommends that federal regulators require improved high-tech inspections of the discs during manufacturing.

Technavio has published a new market research report on the global industrial potato graders market from 2018-2022. (Graphic: Business Wire)
According to Technavio market research analysts, the global industrial potato graders market will grow at a CAGR of close to 5% during the forecast period. The increase in manual labor costs for grading potatoes is a major factor driving the market’s growth.
Over the years, there has been an increase in wages and labor costs in various industries. Potato processing is considered a labor-intensive process as many small-scale manufacturers use manual methods for grading potatoes. Owing to the increase in wages, many potato processing firms are shifting their focus toward mechanizing their operations by installing industrial potato graders. This will help them reduce their overall processing costs and improve profitability.

In this report, Technavio highlights the adoption of PLC-based automation for potato grading as one of the key emerging trends driving the global industrial potato graders market:
Adoption of PLC-based automation for potato grading
The need for automation of various processes has been growing in the food industry. In industrial potato graders, automation is primarily used to reduce human intervention, improve potato grading efficiency, and ensure minimal errors. It also helps in increasing the grading speed and reducing operational costs.
Automated systems use programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) developed by various companies for enhanced monitoring and process control during grading operations.
According to a senior analyst at Technavio for research, “Many potato producers have started using automated potato graders for the smooth running of their production lines. For instance, in January 2017, Neumiller Farms installed a new PLC-based potato grading system in its potato grading facility in Illinois, US. Similarly, in May 2017, Atlantic Potato Distributors announced its plan to add an automated grading and bagging line to its potato-packing facility in New Brunswick, Canada.”

Global industrial potato graders market segmentation
This market research report segments the global by product (size graders and weight graders) and key regions (the Americas, APAC, and EMEA).
The size graders product segment held a market share of over 78% in 2017 and is expected to grow further during the forecast period. Size graders are of two types, namely roller graders and screen graders. The demand for uniformly sized potatoes is increasing among potato processing industries to eliminate issues related to overcooking and undercooking. This is expected to lead to an increase in the market growth of industrial screen graders during the forecast period.
EMEA held the largest share of the global industrial potato graders market in 2017, accounting for a market share of over 39%. Strategic alliances between potato processing companies and industrial potato grader vendors are increasing in EMEA. This is expected to drive the growth of the market in the region.

The PGA Tour began the second half of the season at the Texas Open, with Andrew Landry becoming the seventh first-time winner.
Never mind that it feels as though the season is just getting started.
Still to come are three majors and The Players Championship. Not to be overlooked are the FedEx Cup playoffs. Quibble about points and prestige, but they deliver four tournaments over five weeks of the top available players.
Most sports prefer to become more relevant the closer they get to the finish line, so that's one benefit of the PGA Tour's wraparound season.
The opening 22 weeks featured one major and three World Golf Championships, one of them in Shanghai last October, the other two in March separated by two weeks. Justin Thomas, Bubba Watson and Patton Kizzire are multiple winners. Dustin Johnson should be. Jordan Spieth would settle for one victory at this point.
The first half did a good job setting the table for what should be a compelling five months.
BATTLE FOR NO. 1
Not long after Dustin Johnson closed with a 67 at the RBC Heritage, he left for the Bahamas as part of a three-week break. His tie for 16th at Hilton Head was important. It assured Johnson of staying at No. 1 for a few more weeks, but maybe not by the time he returns at TPC.
He will be No. 1 for at least 62 weeks, significant in that only three other players have stayed atop the world ranking longer since it began in 1986 — Nick Faldo (81 weeks), Greg Norman (96 weeks) and Tiger Woods (264 weeks and 281 weeks).
It might not last much longer. Thomas, who could have replaced Johnson by winning his semifinal match in the Dell Technologies Match Play, gets another chance next week at the Wells Fargo Championship. That's at Quail Hollow, where Thomas won the PGA Championship last summer.
Jon Rahm also had a chance to get to No. 1 in January until a 75-77 weekend at Torrey Pines.
With so many big tournaments coming up, a half-dozen players are in the mix for No. 1 by the end of the season.
BEST SEASON
Patrick Reed can easily claim this because of that green jacket he loves to (and should) show off. Winning the Masters makes it a great year no matter what else happens, and Reed will have a hard time topping this one even if he wins all five Ryder Cup matches in France.
Three others are worthy of consideration.
Thomas faced a most difficult encore after he won five times last season, including his first major, the PGA Championship, and the FedEx Cup. He has backed it up so far with two victories. One of them was the Honda Classic, where he made two birdies on the par-5 18th — with a wedge to force a playoff, and with a 5-wood to set up the win.
Watson won against two strong fields at Riviera and Match Play. Kizzire won't get as much recognition from winning at the OHL Classic at Mayakoba in the fall and the Sony Open in January. But he went head-to-head in beating Rickie Fowler in Mexico and won a six-hole playoff on Oahu. In a rarity, he won twice in a season while ranked outside the top 100 in the world.
TIGER ANNIVERSARY
One year ago, the Texas Open was the same week Woods had his fourth back surgery, and all sorts of speculation followed. Would he ever play again? Did he even want to play again? And if he did, how much would fusion surgery limit him?
The answers: Yes, yes and not much.
He recorded a swing speed of 129 mph. He was runner-up by one shot at the Valspar Championship. A year ago, no one would have been surprised if he missed the Masters. Instead, the surprise was that he didn't break par until Sunday and tied for 32nd.
Interesting about Woods at this point in the season is that he played three of his six tournaments on courses where he has never won.
THE REVIVALS
Even as the PGA Tour gets younger, five players in their 40s managed to win.
Phil Mickelson tops the list. Ian Poulter isn't too far behind.
His victory drought approaching five years, Mickelson was on the verge of falling out of the top 50 in the world for the first time in 25 years when he ran off four consecutive top 10s, the last one a playoff victory in the Mexico Championship.
Poulter had gone more than six years without a win, would have lost his full PGA Tour card last year except for a clerical error and then was told at the Dell Match Play that he was in the Masters, when in fact he needed to win one more match (which he lost badly). Poulter opened with a 73 the following week in Houston, answered with rounds of 64-65, made a 30-foot birdie putt on the 18th to force a playoff and won on the first extra hole to get into the Masters.
Those victories will go a long way in getting Mickelson and Poulter to France in the fall as captain's picks if they don't qualify for their Ryder Cup teams.
But it's early.
Even though one half of the season is gone, the bigger half is coming up.
MADRID (AP) — The Latest on the political crisis in Catalonia (all times local):
10:30 a.m.
The speaker of Catalonia's parliament has postponed a session intended to re-elect the Spanish region's fugitive ex-president.
Roger Torrent announced the decision Tuesday, hours before the session he had called to hold a vote authorizing separatist leader Carles Puigdemont to form a government.
The decision comes after Spain's top court had ruled Puigdemont, who faces arrest in Spain, would have to return from Belgium and ask a judge permission to attend the session.
Torrent says he will reconvene the session once Spanish authorities guarantee they "won't interfere" in the election of Puigdemont.
Puigdemont is the focus of an investigation into October's illegal— and unsuccessful— declaration of independence.

10:15 a.m.
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is urging the Catalan parliament not to press ahead with the candidacy of fugitive leader Carles Puigdemont for regional president and instead to opt for a lawmaker free of legal proceedings.
Speaking Tuesday on Spanish National Television hours before the parliament is scheduled to hold an investiture vote for Puigdemont, Rajoy said the parliament speaker will face legal consequences if he disobeys a Constitutional Court order saying Puigdemont can only be voted on if he is physically present and has previously obtained court permission.
Puigdemont faces arrest if he returns to Spain.
Rajoy said the "most sensible" thing for the parliament speaker would be to propose a "clean candidate" who is willing to obey the law and work for the return of normality in Catalonia.
HONOLULU (AP) — Every day, tourists flock to a downtown Honolulu palace for a glimpse of the way Hawaii's royal family lived, marveling at its gilded furniture, lavish throne room and grand staircase made from prized koa wood.
But few know Iolani Palace — America's only royal residence — has relied in part on the generosity of a descendant of that family while the relic of the monarchy's rule now serves as a museum.
Multimillionaire heiress Abigail Kinoiki Kekaulike Kawananakoa, considered by many to be Hawaii's last princess, has paid the palace's electric bills for the past six years.
But the intensely private Native Hawaiian, whose $215 million fortune includes race horses and real estate, is no longer in a position to fund her pet charities, including the palace and various Native Hawaiian causes.
A court struggle is playing out for the 91-year-old's fortune. Her longtime lawyer persuaded a judge to appoint him trustee, arguing a stroke over the summer left the heiress impaired. She claims she's fine, and has since fired that lawyer and married her girlfriend of 20 years.
Since the court battle began, the electricity payments have stopped, Iolani Palace Executive Director Kippen de Alba Chu said. Officials who run the palace completed in 1882 have relied on a backup plan to pay the light bill and stay open.
Also disrupted, according to court documents, were funds earmarked for a Native Hawaiian nursing student's scholarship and materials to repair a damaged crypt at the Royal Mausoleum, where members of Hawaiian royalty are buried.
Over the years, Kawananakoa has used her money to fund protesters fighting a giant telescope on a mountain some Native Hawaiians consider sacred; to challenge a contentious Honolulu rail project; and to support the Merrie Monarch Festival, a prestigious hula competition.
She also has donated items owned by King Kalakaua and Queen Kapiolani for public display, including Kalakaua's nearly 14-carat diamond pinky ring.
Kawananakoa is the granddaughter of the late Prince David Kawananakoa, who was named an heir to the throne. She has no official title or real power in the state, but that doesn't matter to many Native Hawaiians, who see her as a link to when Hawaii was its own nation — before American businessmen, backed by U.S. Marines, overthrew the Hawaiian kingdom 125 years ago.
"She was always called princess among Hawaiians because Hawaiians have acknowledged that lineage," said Kimo Alama Keaulana, assistant professor of Hawaiian language and studies at Honolulu Community College. "Hawaiians hold dear to genealogy. And so genealogically speaking, she is of high royal blood."
Some note that Prince David has other living descendants and say the heiress is held up as the last tie to the monarchy simply because of her wealth. Kawananakoa's riches come from being the great-granddaughter of James Campbell, an Irish businessman who made his fortune as a sugar plantation owner and one of Hawaii's largest landowners.
But Kawananakoa's supporters say she is the closest connection to the throne because, although they were already related, the prince's widow formally adopted her as a daughter.
Last princess or not, Kawananakoa's inheritance wields tangible power — and some worry about it falling into the wrong hands.
In July, her longtime attorney James Wright filed an emergency petition seeking to be named successor trustee to all of her trust assets, saying in court documents that Kawananakoa is "impaired as a result of an acute stroke."
Two days later, a judge granted the request.
In August, attorney Michael Lilly wrote a letter to the judge saying he now represents Kawananakoa and he strongly contests any contention she is incompetent.
Lawyers for the heiress dispute she had a stroke, saying in court papers it was a transient ischemic attack, which has similar symptoms but caused no permanent damage.
Wright's court filings also raise allegations that Veronica Gail Worth, Kawananakoa's 64-year-old wife, physically abused her.
Neither Kawananakoa nor Worth responded to requests for comment from The Associated Press. However, Kawananakoa's attorney said in court papers the abuse claims are false and that Kawananakoa fell and "struck furniture, which caused the bruising, which is not uncommon at someone her age."
A judge in September appointed a special master to independently investigate the heiress's mental capacity and the abuse allegations.
Kawananakoa largely avoids airing her personal life, and some who know her say even her Oct. 1 wedding at the home of a retired state Supreme Court justice came as a surprise.
But she has occasionally drawn attention over the years, including in 1993, when one of her horses won $1 million in New Mexico's All American Futurity.
Five years later, furor erupted after Kawananakoa sat on a palace throne for a Life magazine photo shoot. She damaged some of its fragile threads, but repairs were made and the throne was returned to the palace throne room. Still, the uproar led to Kawananakoa's ouster as president of Friends of Iolani Palace, a position she held for more than 25 years.
Some Hawaiians, such as well-known activist Walter Ritte, aren't interested in revering her genealogy or wealth. Hawaiians, especially those who live in poverty, can't relate to her, Ritte said.
"She has given some money here and there," he said. "She could have done a lot more for Hawaiians."
The court battle focusing on Kawananakoa's age and health has others reflecting on her as a final living reminder of Hawaii's monarchy and as a symbol of a proud Hawaiian national identity that has endured.
"It is fair to say that Abigail Kawananakoa is the last of our alii," said Keaulana, using the Hawaiian word for royalty. "She epitomizes what Hawaiian royalty is — in all its dignity and intelligence and art."
Palace officials will be watching the case. A hearing is tentatively scheduled for Feb. 8.

Inshore
The summer snook spawn is in full swing. The beaches and inlets are still your bets for snook fishing. Buck tail jigs and live bait fished near the bottom and around the mouths of the inlets will work well. Always be cautious kayak fishing in the inlet. Strong currents and large boats are things to be aware of. Be sure to have a PFD and all safety equipment for any inlet trip. A good kayak launch is the south side of Jupiter inlet. Try fishing the outside of the north and south jetty as well as drifting the current in the main channel.
Offshore
Expect the offshore kingfish bite to remain consistent especially in the Singer Island area. Fishing the normal depths of 70-150 will put you in the zone for kings. Fishing Boynton Beach area will put you in closer proximity to deep water for the sailfish, mahi and wahoo. If looking to get on a mahi bite look to run out 5-8 miles to find a few fish. Most will be small, but there are chances for a big bull. The wahoo bite should be on the mind this month. Running baits deeper in the water column anywhere from 60-80’ below surface will give you the best opportunity to land a wahoo.

See you on the water!

BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) — A Canadian man has admitted to smuggling handguns from the United States into Canada, including some that were left in a library that straddles the border of Vermont and Canada.
Authorities say 40-year-old Alexis Vlachos, of Montreal, pleaded guilty Monday in federal court in Burlington. He could be sentenced to 20 years in prison.
Court documents say that between 2010 and 2011, Vlachos worked with others to get about 100 handguns purchased from dealers in Florida into Canada, which restricts handgun ownership.
Some of the guns were left at the Haskell Library by an accomplice. Vlachos then retrieved them and took then into Canada. Other guns were carried across a remote stretch of border.
Vlachos' lawyer Paul Volk says the facts will be further developed prior to sentencing in May.
LONDON (AP) — A British judge has handed a prison sentence to a homeless man who admitted stealing from victims of the Manchester Arena bombing while pretending to help them.
Chris Parker received worldwide renown after claiming to have helped comfort the injured and the dying after suicide bomber Salman Abedi detonated a bomb at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on May 22, killing 22 people.
Though first praised as a hero, closed-circuit TV footage showed the 33-year-old Parker stealing a purse and mobile phone from victims.
In sentencing Parker to four years and three months, Judge David Hernandez said it was hard to imagine a "more reprehensible set of circumstances."
Hernandez told Parker: "You were not the hero you pretended to be, you were just a common thief."

ALAMEDA, Calif. -- Jon Gruden yelled out instructions, called out plays and ran an NFL practice for the first time since leaving coaching nearly a decade ago in Tampa Bay.This was the day Gruden had been waiting for ever since he was hired for a second stint as Oakland Raiders coach.The Raiders opened their first voluntary minicamp under Gruden on Tuesday with optimism that a change in coach can alter the fortunes of a team coming off a down season."The practice field has always been a laboratory for a coach," Gruden said. "That's where we earn our pay. We have to develop this team. We have to learn a lot about them quickly. We have a lot of things to teach, a lot of things to improve. It was fun to be out there. I don't want to be too deep or philosophical or I might start crying."While only the first 30 minutes of practice were open to the media, there was a different vibe than in previous years with Gruden's loud voice replacing music as the soundtrack on the field.There were even large video boards on the field, allowing players to watch replays of practice plays immediately after they happened to make corrections more quickly. Gruden said that was something he first saw watching Jim Harbaugh's practices at Michigan and adopted it himself.Gruden viewed this minicamp as an examination to see how well the players have learned the plays and system in meeting rooms the past two weeks. Gruden said he tried to throw a few extra wrinkles at quarterback Derek Carr and was pleased with how he responded."He threw everything at me," Carr said. "He tried to get me to see if I was listening to him in the meetings. We had a lot of fun doing that. It's always fun to accept his challenge and hopefully do good at it and look at him or wink at him or something like that. We have fun together because we both have the same goal of putting the ship in the water and hitting this thing running."Gruden takes over a team that fell from 12 wins in 2016 to just six last season, leading to the firing of coach Jack Del Rio and a second stint for Gruden in Oakland. The Raiders' facility looks far different than it did during Gruden's first tenure from 1998 to 2001 thanks to a workout center that Del Rio initiated and new fields.The team needs plenty of work after last year's disappointment.The Raiders had major drops in scoring (26 to 18.8), yards per game (373.3 to 324.1) and committed twice as many turnovers (14 to 28) this past season as Carr took a major step back in his development while dealing with a back injury for part of the season.But Gruden sees great potential for Carr to get back to the level he reached in 2016, when his play helped earn him a $125 million, five-year extension in the offseason."I got really excited out there today," Gruden said. "You can have a really creative imagination with that guy at the quarterback position. He can make every throw. It comes out of his hand fast and accurate. He's mobile and sharp. He's a great leader."The defense became the first in NFL history to fail to record an interception in the first 10 games of the season and generated only 14 takeaways all season compared to 30 in 2016.The Raiders have brought in more than 20 free agents this offseason as Gruden has tried to put his imprint on the team. One of the most significant moves was the signing of receiver Jordy Nelson to replace Michael Crabtree , who was released to make room.But there are also some key pieces missing, most notably 2016 AP Defensive Player of the Year Khalil Mack , who is not participating in the offseason program while seeking a long-term contract before he can become a free agent next offseason.Starting left tackle Donald Penn is still recovering from foot surgery and last year's top two draft picks, cornerback Gareon Conley (shin) and safety Obi Melifonwu (hip), aren't taking part in team drills.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Aging experts and advocates are telling a government commission that age-related discrimination in the workplace still exists 50 years after the enactment of legislation designed to prevent it.
Laurie McCann, senior attorney for the AARP Foundation Litigation, says the law "should not be treated as a second-class civil rights statute." She is urging the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to be more aggressive in pursuing age discrimination cases.
The EEOC's acting chair, Victoria Lipnic, is pledging to do so, to ensure that job opportunities are based on ability not age.
During Wednesday's meeting, EEOC commissioners listened to McCann and other experts and asked questions about discrimination and possible solutions.
The agency receives about 20,000 age discrimination complaints a year. Lipnic says women are more likely to file complaints than men.

If you're a gamer who grew up in the 1980s (like me), odds are you helped Link rescue Princess Zelda or Mario defeat King Bowser on a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Thirty-plus years later, Nintendo is helping those gamers relive their old-school victories with the NES Classic Edition.
Released in November 2016, the NES Classic Edition is a pint-size version of the original system. It comes with a single two-button controller and 30 preloaded games, including old favorites like Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda, Donkey Kong, Metroid and Ghosts'n Goblins. The original NES Classic Edition was discontinued in April 2017. Nintendo has said that that console will return to stores on June 29, 2018.
How did Nintendo pack so much 8-bit fun into a single box? To find out, I broke out my tools.
Note: This story originally ran in the Fall 2017 issue of CNET Magazine. We're publishing the story online to coincide with our Cracking Open video of the NES Classic and the original NES.
Cracking open the NES Classic Edition
I started with the four rubber pads, or feet, on the console's bottom. Using a thin Phillips screwdriver, I removed the pads and the tiny screw hidden underneath each one. I then lifted off the upper half of the system's plastic case to reveal the tech inside.
Though it's less than a quarter the size of the original NES, the Classic Edition's interior is far less cramped. Gone are the front-loading, VCR-esque cartridge tray, the 72-pin cartridge connector that failed so often and the bulky video, audio and power circuitry. All that 1980s tech has been condensed down to a single main circuit board that's about the size of a drink coaster.
After disconnecting the cables for the two game controller ports and a thin cable for the power and reset buttons, I removed a few more screws, lifted off the metal shield that covers the main circuit board and took out the board itself.
Next, I removed the two controller ports, each held in place with a small bracket and single screw. To finish, I only had to disconnect a black, plastic housing that contains a small circuit board to which the contacts for the power and reset buttons are mounted along with the front LED. My teardown of the console was complete.
Turning my attention to the game controller, I removed six screws from the bottom of its clamshell case and then separated the two halves. Inside is a single rectangular circuit board.
The entire cracking-open process took less than 15 minutes and was the simplest teardown I've ever done.
CNET/TechRepublic
What the teardown tells us
Simple to crack open: The only tool you really need to disassemble the NES Classic Edition is a small Phillips screwdriver (#00 or #000 should work). There's no glue inside the console or the controller, all the internal components are easily accessible and the screws are all the same diameter and length.
More tech packed into a smaller package: The Classic Edition has a quad-core ARM processor, 256MB of RAM and 512MB of storage. For comparison, the original NES had an 8-bit processor, 2KB of work RAM, 2KB of video RAM and no game storage.
NES emulator on a single-board computer: The Classic Edition is basically a Nintendo-sanctioned NES emulator running on a Linux single-board computer. Yes, Linux. And if you're wondering whether it's possible to hack the Classic Edition and load more games? That answer is also yes. There's plenty of information on the internet that will show you how to update the system's software and install additional games. But be warned: There's always a chance that modifying your system could cause irreparable damage. More importantly, downloading and using games for which you don't already own a license for is usually illegal.
Yesterday's games running on today's tech
The NES Classic Edition is pure retro gaming fun. It's a much easier way to play old NES games than hunting through flea markets or online auctions for original hardware. And, it's less complicated (and more legal) than running emulator software with downloaded games on a PC.
Unfortunately, after selling over 2 million Classic Editions, Nintendo unexpectedly discontinued the console in April 2017. If you didn't manage to scoop one up then, you may still be able to buy one online, albeit at a likely inflated price. It's also being released again on June 29. We shelled out $200 for the one I cracked open, which is way more than the $60, £50 or AU$100 retail price.
Perhaps what stood out the most to me after cracking open the NES Classic Edition was just how much technology has improved in the past three decades. The hardware inside the Classic Edition is tiny compared with the original system, yet it's so much more powerful. I can't wait to see how far technology advances in the next 30 years.

Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi on Sunday said that his government suspects Israel of being behind the assassination of Hamas engineer Mohamed Zaouari, Haaretz reported.
Zaouari, an aviation scientist, was shot to death outside his home in Sfax, Tunisia, on December 15. Hamas said two days after his death that he was a member of the organization's military wing and one of the leaders of its drone program. The group at the time also blamed Israel for his death.
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Indiana will remain one of just five states without a hate crimes law after key lawmakers in the GOP-dominated Senate announced Tuesday that they were abandoning a bill targeting crimes motivated by bias.
Leaders of Indiana's GOP-dominated Statehouse have consistently opposed hate crimes legislation. But that changed this year in the wake of clashes between white supremacists and counter demonstrators in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left one woman dead in August.
The bill by Republican Sen. Sue Glick had support from GOP leaders, including House Speaker Brian Bosma and Senate leader David Long. Then on Tuesday the chairman of a key Senate committee decided to not take a vote on the bill.
"It's a matter of peoples' opinions. We just couldn't come to consensus," Long, of Fort Wayne, said late at a press conference announcing the effort was done for the year.
A deep thread of social conservatism runs throughout the state and lawmakers, headed into an election year, faced intense pressure from activists who argue that creating a hate crimes law would create a special protected class of victims.
At the same time, much of Indiana's business community was in lock-step support of the measure, which they say is important to lure talent and new business to the state.
Indianapolis was named one of 20 finalists competing to be the location of a second Amazon headquarters. A coalition of central Indiana municipal officials, including Republicans, had pushed for a hate crimes law in hopes of making the state more appealing.
Despite his support for the measure, Long dismissed their worries.
"I really don't think it should affect anything," said Long. "Nor do I think we should tailor all of our legislation in hopes that a company would locate here. I would hope they'd be coming to Indiana because we are a welcoming state, because we have a great economy and we have low cost of living."
The bill by Glick, a former county prosecutor from LaGrange County, would have specifically allowed a judge to take into account whether a crime was motivated by someone's race, religion, color, sex, gender identity, disability, national origin, ancestry, sexual orientation or ethnicity. It would also require such crimes to be reported to the FBI. Currently, Indiana law enforcement agencies are not required to do so.
Advocates say anecdotal accounts suggest the number of so-called bias crimes are on the rise and the Southern Poverty Law Center reports 26 active hate groups in the state.
Democratic Sen. Greg Taylor, of Indianapolis, ripped Republicans for being content with the status quo.
"What we did today was say to companies like Amazon ... 'We don't need your business, we don't need your economic development, we don't need your jobs,'" said Taylor. "We are comfortable with the status quo."
Make Your Island Plans Now – Bahamas Ministry Boating Flings Launch in June
For many boat owners in Florida and the southeast U.S., a trip to the Bahamas is on their bucket list. However, many are concerned with their ability to cross the Gulf Stream. Enter the Bahamas Summer Boating Fling Program. For over 30 years, the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism has been organizing summer flotillas to teach Gulf Stream-crossing newbies how to safely make the crossing in a fun and relaxed atmosphere.
Under the guidance of a lead boat and experienced captain, participants in the Bahamas Boating Flings make the Gulf Stream crossing in a group. Flings depart from Bahia Mar Yachting Center in Ft. Lauderdale. In year’s past, when several boaters plan to depart from the Treasure Coast, the Ministry has arranged either a Treasure Coast lead boat or a rendezvous point mid-Gulfstream for the groups to merge and cross together.
Flings begin on Thursdays. Wednesday before all trips is a mandatory Captain’s meeting. Trips end on Sundays.
If interested, register early as space is limited to 30 boats. Dockage space is on a first-come first-served basis. Minimum boat length for all flings is 22 feet. There is a $75 non-refundable registration fee per boat, per fling.
So, go grab a Kalik, a Sands or your favorite rum concoction—and let the island countdown begin!
Here is the summer 2017 itinerary:

MADRID (AP) — Six of nine prominent Catalan separatist politicians jailed for promoting the region's drive to secede from Spain have been moved to prisons closer to their homes.
Some observers see the prison transfer as a goodwill gesture by the central Spanish authorities ahead of a key meeting next week between Spain's new prime minister and Catalonia's new regional president, amid hopes for a thaw in relations between Madrid and the Catalan capital Barcelona.
But Catalan President Quim Torra rejected that interpretation Wednesday and stuck to his hard line on Catalan independence.
Torra said in a statement outside the Catalan regional parliament in Barcelona that the transfer is stipulated by law and "is not part of any negotiation."
He says the Catalan conflict with Madrid is political, not legal.
OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — The Ottawa Senators are hopeful that star defenseman Erik Karlsson will be ready for the start of next season following surgery on his left foot Wednesday.
General manager Pierre Dorion says Karlsson's recovery from surgery to repair torn tendons in the foot would take approximately four months.
The 27-year-old Swede was injured during the playoffs, though he still piled up 18 points in 19 games and played 28 minutes per game. Ottawa lost in the Eastern Conference final to eventual Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh.
After the first round against Boston, Karlsson revealed that he had been playing through hairline fractures in that same left foot — an injury suffered in late March. Ottawa said the tendon damage was found during an MRI following the season.
A four-month timeline would allow for Karlsson to return in mid-October.

NEW DELHI (AP) — The leaders of India and Cambodia on Saturday agreed to work toward a bilateral investment treaty that could see tens of millions of dollars pour into the Southeast Asian nation.
The meeting between Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi saw Cambodia invite Indian investment in information technology, pharmaceuticals, agriculture and horticulture, infrastructure and small and medium enterprises.
A broader treaty will take time but India agreed to provide lines of credit, including nearly $37 million to finance a Cambodian water project. India also offered lines of credit for setting up specialty hospitals, expanding road, rail and digital connectivity and construction of a high-powered electric line.
A joint statement said Modi also offered to train Cambodian youth in information technology.
The leaders held talks in New Delhi at the end of a summit attended by 10 Southeast Asian leaders commemorating the 25th anniversary of ASEAN-India ties.
India is seeking to deepen bonds with Southeast Asia amid wariness over China's growing influence in the region.
Modi also reaffirmed India's commitment to undertake restoration and conservation work at the ancient temple of Lord Shiva at Preah Vihear in Cambodia.
The two sides expressed satisfaction over the ongoing restoration work at Ta Prohm temple being carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India.
The Cambodian prime minister will conclude his visit to India on Sunday.

NEW YORK (AP) — The Weinstein Co. has filed for bankruptcy protection with a buyout offer in hand from a private equity firm, the latest twist in its efforts to survive the sexual abuse scandal that brought down co-founder Harvey Weinstein.
The company also announced on Monday that it was releasing any victims of or witnesses to Weinstein's alleged misconduct from any non-disclosure agreement that would prevent them from speaking out.
In a statement, the company says it "expressly releases any confidentiality provision" to the extent that it has prevented anyone who "suffered or witnessed any form of sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein from telling their stories."
The Weinstein Co. says it has entered into sale agreement with Lantern Capital Partners, subject to approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A United Parcel Service driver who opened fire during a meeting with co-workers had filed a grievance that he was working excessive overtime.
UPS union official Joseph Cilia told The Associated Press that 38-year-old Jimmy Lam had filed the grievance in March and had requested that the package delivery company relieve him of working extra hours going forward.
Lam appeared to specifically go after the three drivers he killed before fatally shooting himself.
Officials late Wednesday confirmed 50-year-old Benson Louie, 56-year-old Wayne Chan, and 46-year-old Mike Lefiti were killed in the shooting.
Two other UPS employees were wounded, but Cilia said both were released from the hospital.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Jeff Sessions was in his office, looking unusually deflated. He had just received another public lashing from President Donald Trump.
Trump had browbeaten his attorney general for months after Sessions' decision to step aside from the intensifying Russia investigation. Never mind that Sessions has proved fiercely devoted to his boss, carrying out Trump's agenda while giving him credit every step of the way. Trump was unforgiving.
This attack came on an autumn day, and Sessions discussed it with a longtime friend and adviser who had stopped by to chat.
Sessions shrugged. "I do the best I can," he said. Then he got back to work.
And, somewhat surprisingly, he's still working.
Sessions will soon mark his first year on the job, having survived a barrage of insults from Trump, antipathy from some Justice Department employees and even calls from some fellow Republicans for him to resign. Last week, America's top law enforcement officer was himself questioned as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible obstruction of justice and Trump campaign ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
Trump's relentless attacks have been a wearing distraction, say friends and associates of the former Alabama senator. The Associated Press interviewed more than a dozen of them, many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private interactions.
What keeps him going, friends say, is his Methodist faith, support from his wife and his awareness that, at age 71, leading the Justice Department is his best and perhaps final chance to carry out the policy changes he long has sought.
Sessions, the first senator to endorse Trump's candidacy, declined to be interviewed for this story but did agree to respond to written questions. He did not directly address his personal relationship with Trump but said his first year was marked by progress on a number of Trump's priorities: fighting crime, combating gangs and helping police.
"We are doing what the people sent us here to do," he said.
While Sessions is proud of his first year, friends see signs of stress. At an annual Justice Department Christmas party, one friend noted, the usually upbeat attorney general looked sullen and tired.
"We have talked about some of the difficult times he's had since he has been attorney general," said the Senate's second-ranking Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, a Sessions' confidant. "My comment to him was, as long as you're doing the right thing, I don't think you have anything to apologize for."
What Sessions sees as doing the right thing, though, often appears to others as doing Trump's bidding.
Critics say Sessions is too loyal, dangerously politicizing his department in an effort to appease Trump. Sessions told senior prosecutors to look into Hillary Clinton's activities after Trump demanded investigations of his 2016 Democratic rival, and he has been eager to pursue investigations into Trump grievances, such as media leaks. Lawmakers accuse Sessions of stonewalling congressional committees investigating the Trump campaign by repeatedly saying he doesn't recall key events.
Some say Sessions' public silence in the face of Trump's assaults on the department is demoralizing to employees and threatens its independence from the White House. Sessions said Friday that it's the department's responsibility to identify past mistakes and that a "culture of defensiveness is not acceptable."
"It seems he recognizes he is in such a weakened position, if he wants to stay in Trump's good graces he has to at least make a show of responding to Trump's demands, and that's extremely dangerous," said William Yeomans, who spent nearly 30 years at the department under Democratic and Republican administrations.
One example that raised eyebrows: Sessions' plan to confront the opioid crisis hews so closely to Trump's that White House aide Kellyanne Conway was on hand in the Justice Department's seventh-floor conference room when he announced it.
Sessions declined to address specific actions by his department but said it carries out "the law without regard to the political consequences or to poll numbers or who benefits and who doesn't," and Trump supports that.
Even if Sessions is complying with Trump's demands and pursuing his agenda, the attorney general has yet to find himself back in favor with the president. Before Sessions' decision to withdraw from the Russia investigation, Trump used to call Sessions periodically and seek his counsel. Now the two men rarely speak, and Sessions at times has resorted to asking West Wing aides to pass messages to Trump.
The rupture stems from Sessions' move on March 2 to step aside from that investigation after acknowledging he had had two previously undisclosed encounters with the Russian ambassador in Washington during Trump's campaign. Sessions said it would be improper for him to oversee an investigation into a campaign in which he played a prominent role.
Trump was furious. Sessions had disregarded a plea from Trump's White House lawyer, Don McGahn, who, at Trump's request, had urged the attorney general to retain oversight of the investigation. But by then, Sessions had already consulted with ethics officials and had made up his mind. Sessions' action left Trump without a close political appointee keeping a hand in the investigation of his campaign,
Sessions offered to resign. Trump declined to accept it. Sacking Sessions would have been politically perilous for the president.
But the barrage of tweets and public and private comments from Trump haven't ended. He disparaged Sessions in comparisons with Eric Holder, whom Trump says he respects for protecting President Barack Obama while serving as attorney general.
Sessions has endured with a courtly stoicism. If he's frustrated, friends said, he mostly keeps it to himself. At a recent get-together with Terry Lathan, a friend and chairwoman of the Alabama Republican Party, Sessions seemed more interested in what was going on back home than in complaining about job pressures.
"He's not going to sit around and yank the president's tie in private conversation with a group of his buddies," said Ken Blackwell, a domestic policy adviser to Trump's transition team who has known Sessions for years. "He's more like, this is what we need to get done, how do we get it done?"
Trump's antagonism has distressed Sessions' friends and supporters because they don't believe Sessions' stepping aside from the Russia investigation was a close call. One Sessions' ally said the attorney general's attitude remains that he is going to work 18-hour days to promote the administration's agenda.
Trump's priorities reflect the interests Sessions long has advocated, first as a federal prosecutor and then as a senator: illegal immigration, violent crime, illegal drugs, defending the rights of those who say they've been discriminated against based on religion.
"President Trump knows how to give clear orders, and he told us to reduce crime, take on the gangs and cartels, and back the men and women in blue," Sessions said. "The good news for us is that these directives are exactly what I want to do."
That agenda has unsettled liberals who say Sessions' focus on tough prosecutions marks a return to failed tactics that unduly hurt minorities and the poor. They say his rollbacks of protections for gay and transgender people amount to discrimination.
For Sessions, there's satisfaction in being able to reverse Obama-era policies that he and other conservatives say flouted the will of Congress. "The progress he has made has been very gratifying to him," said former Attorney General Ed Meese, who sees Sessions periodically.
Sessions takes pride in his many visits to U.S. attorney offices, where he speaks with local authorities, some of his most ardent fans, about how the federal government can help them. During a particularly tense stretch in November, when Sessions faced attacks from Trump and members of Congress, department officials held a call urging law enforcement groups to be vocally supportive of him, a person familiar with the call said.
Jonathan Thompson, executive director of the National Sheriffs' Association, recalled a December meeting when Sessions said he had to cut his appearance short. His voice was hoarse and he lamented his full schedule.
"He said, 'I wish I could sit here and talk with you all day,'" before his staff moved him along, said Thompson.

LANSING, Mich. (AP) — A government safety panel on Monday urged the temporary shutdown of twin oil pipelines in the Straits of Mackinac until their operator can finish inspections and repair coating gaps, after some members expressed concerns over a recent deal between the state and Enbridge Inc.
The Michigan Pipeline Safety Advisory Board approved the non-binding resolution after members of Gov. Rick Snyder's administration who sit on the panel abstained from voting. Other non-binding resolutions call for temporarily halting the flow of oil during storms that produce sustained waves at least 3 feet (0.9 meter) high for longer than an hour, instead of an 8-foot (2.4-meter) threshold included in the agreement, and recommended that a "more robust" study of alternatives to Line 5 be completed.
The agreement, announced Nov. 27, sets an Aug. 15 deadline for determining the future of the nearly 5-mile-long (8-kilometer) segment beneath the channel where Lakes Huron and Michigan converge. Options include shutting down the pipeline or routing it through a tunnel beneath the lakebed where it now rests.
Because five or six members of the 16-person board voted for the measures while many others abstained, there was confusion over whether they had passed. Co-chairwoman Valerie Brader, executive director of the Michigan Agency for Energy, said she expected the Republican governor's administration to consider the resolutions as advisory while also taking note of the number of abstentions.
Board member Jennifer McKay of the Tip of the Mitt Watershed Council said she hopes the governor gives the resolutions "due consideration" and seeks amendments to the deal. Although the federal government regulates oil pipelines, Michigan owns the lake bottom and in 1953 granted an easement to the Canadian company allowing the pipeline to go there.
"We know we have coating gaps. It's a violation of the easement and it only makes sense to shut down the pipeline until Enbridge can adequately address and fix the coating issues to ensure we don't have any type of rupture or leak," she said.
The line transports about 23 million gallons (87 million liters) daily between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario.
At least four board members expressed frustration that Snyder struck the agreement without their input, contending it short-circuited the public process and signals that tunneling the pipeline is ultimately the state's preference. State officials on the board, however, said the deal is an interim one and is not intended to "prejudge" the fate of the pipeline.
"Certainly apologies if there was any perceived disrespect," said Michigan Department of Natural Resources Director Keith Creagh. "As we heard about the entire length of the pipeline, there were some measures put into place ... to ensure that there was a higher standard essentially in the interim as this board contemplates the future of Line 5."
While not ruling out a permanent shutdown, the agreement includes a series of steps intended to boost the underwater pipes' safety. Enbridge agreed to evaluate three options by June for routing the underwater segment through a tunnel or trench, on or beneath the lakebed — either using the existing pipes or building a new one.
The company promised steps to prevent the lines from being damaged by a ship anchor, expedite monitoring of the pipelines with cameras or other devices, and speed up methods for detecting potential ruptures and responding to spills.
Additionally, Enbridge said it would replace another section of Line 5 beneath the St. Clair River where it crosses the U.S.-Canadian border with a new pipe inside a tunnel after receiving federal and state permits.

SHAFTSBURY, Vt. (AP) — The Robert Frost Stone House Museum is ready to reopen under new ownership.
The Friends of Robert Frost announced last September that it was donating the house, seven acres of property, and two barns to Bennington college.
It's due to open for the season on May 3.
The Benning Banner reports that Frost purchased the house in 1920 and lived there until 1929. He was living in the house when he won his first Pulitzer Prize, as well as when he composed many of his poems, including "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening."
Frost's house will remain open to the public but also will be incorporated into college programs and studies.

HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) — Alabama Democrats see Tuesday's special Senate election as a chance to renounce a history littered with politicians whose race-baiting, bombast and other baggage have long soiled the state's reputation beyond its borders.
Many Republicans see the vote as chance to ratify their conservative values and protect President Donald Trump's agenda ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.
At the center are Republican Roy Moore, a former jurist twice removed as state chief justice and now accused of sexual misconduct with teenage girls decades ago, and Democrat Doug Jones, an erstwhile federal prosecutor best known for prosecuting two Ku Klux Klansmen responsible for killing four black girls in the 1963 bombing of Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church.
The winner will take the seat held previously by Trump's attorney general, Jeff Sessions. Republicans control the Senate with 52 seats.
In truth, the matchup mixes both Alabama's tortured history and the nation's current divisive, bitterly partisan politics, and it has made a spectacle of a Deep South state well acquainted with national scrutiny but not accustomed to competitive general elections.
"This is an election to tell the whole world what we stand for," Jones told supporters at one stop Sunday, adding that his campaign "is on the right side of history." At an earlier appearance, he declared Alabama is "at a crossroads" and that Moore, an unapologetic evangelical populist, tries only to "create conflict and division."
Jones, 63, stops short of explicitly comparing Moore to the four-term Gov. George Wallace, whose populism was rooted in segregation. But Jones alluded Sunday to that era of Alabama politics.
"Elect a responsible man to a responsible office," Jones said, repeating the campaign slogan of another Alabama governor, Albert Brewer, who nearly defeated Wallace in 1970 in a contest Alabama liberals and many moderates still lament as a lost opportunity.
Some of Jones' supporters put it even more bluntly. "I thought Alabama's image was pretty much at the bottom," said Pat Lawrence, a retired software engineer in Huntsville. A Moore win, Lawrence added, "will be a whole new bottom."
Those concerns extend even to some GOP quarters. Alabama's senior senator, Richard Shelby, confirmed Sunday that he did not vote for Moore, saying he wrote in another "distinguished" party figure he declined to name.
Yet for many Republicans, Moore is a paragon of traditional values. They reject accusations that he molested two teenage girls and pursued relationships with others decades ago. Moore denies the charges.
"Everyone has to vote their convictions," said Kevin Mims of Montgomery, as he held his Bible outside his Baptist church Sunday in Montgomery. "My conviction is he's the right man for the job."
Where Moore's critics see a state judge who defied federal courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court's decision legalizing same-sex marriage, Mims see a stalwart who stands "on the word of God." Other conservatives see an anti-establishment firebrand in the mold of Trump, who won Alabama by 28 percentage points.
Moore encourages that view with fundraising emails that urge backers to help him "defeat the elite," a swipe at both Democrats and the establishment Republicans who tried to deny him the GOP nomination earlier this year.
Ultimately, Republicans from Moore to Trump himself are betting on a simple bottom line: Most Alabama conservatives simply won't defect to a Democrat.
"If Alabama elects liberal Democrat Doug Jones, all of our progress will be stopped cold," Trump says in a robocall the Moore campaign plans to push out Monday.
The president also invokes a common fear among Republicans, calling Jones "a puppet of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer," the Democratic House and Senate leaders in Washington, both of them reviled by conservative voters. "Roy Moore is the guy we need to pass our Make American Great Again agenda," the president insists.
Moore's baggage could make it difficult to draw conclusions about what the results might mean beyond Alabama, but both parties are watching closely.
Democrats need to flip 24 GOP-held seats to reclaim a House majority, and they're trying to dent the slim Republican advantage in the Senate and its dominance of statehouses around the country. In many of those races, they'll need the same thing Jones must get to win in Alabama: strong turnout among young and non-white voters, along with improved performance among suburban moderates.
A Jones victory would be hailed as a potential precursor, and Democrats have indicated they have a post-Alabama strategy even if Jones loses: They'll take Alabama's brand national, hammering Republicans as "the party of Donald Trump and Roy Moore."

MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — A suicide bomber detonated an explosives-laden vehicle at the gate of a popular restaurant in Somalia's capital, and gunmen were fighting their way inside, police said Wednesday night.
A hostage situation was under way at the Pizza House restaurant, said Capt. Mohamed Hussein. Many of the restaurant's workers are foreigners, mostly from Ethiopia.
Hussein had no immediate information about any casualties.
The Somalia-based extremist group al-Shabab often targets high-profile areas of Mogadishu, including hotels, military checkpoints and areas near the presidential palace. It has vowed to step up attacks after the recently elected government launched a new military offensive against it.
Al-Shabab last year became the deadliest Islamic extremist group in Africa, with more than 4,200 people killed in 2016, according to the Washington-based Africa Center for Strategic Studies.

CINCINNATI (AP) — A bridge that carries highway traffic across the Ohio River near Cincinnati has been serving tens of thousands more vehicles a day than it was designed to handle.
The Cincinnati Enquirer ( ) reports time and traffic are wearing on the Brent Spence Bridge, which is frequently cited as a location where major infrastructure upgrades are needed.
It is increasingly showing rust and cracks, but maintenance officials say it remains structurally sound.
It was made to handle 80,000 vehicles in 1963, and the addition of a fourth lane in 1985 brought that capacity to 120,000. But the most recent data indicate the bridge had daily traffic of over 185,000 vehicles in 2015, nearing a record amount.
That has meant more crashes there, too — usually at least two per week.

Former minister Rafi Eitan causes firestorm after recording message of support for far-right Alternative for Germany(AfD) party.
Former Israeli minister Rafi Eitan caused a firestorm on Saturday after recording a message of support for the far-right Alternative for Germany(AfD) party.
The video was posted by AfD's Twitter account on Friday. In it, Eitan says, "Please accept our greetings from Israel, especially to your chairman Mr. [Alexander] Gauland.”
"All of us in Israel appreciate your attitude towards Judaism. We read your (statement) on January 27, for International Holocaust Memorial Day," Eitan continues.
"I am sure that if you work wisely, strongly and most importantly realistically... that instead of Alternative for Germany, you might become an Alternative for Europe," he adds.
The 91-year-old Eitan, who served as Israel's Minister of Pensioner Affairs between 2006 and 2009, led the Mossad operation to capture Nazi criminal Adolf Eichmann.
The AfD captured nearly 13 percent of the vote and almost 100 seats in parliament in the September election.
Gauland, whom Eitan praised in his message, caused an uproar when he said at an election rally that the Germans no longer needed to hear reproaches about their Nazi past and that they should be proud of the achievements of their soldiers in both World Wars, including the one in which they murdered six million Jews.
Gauland asserted following the election that Jews should not fear the strong election showing by AfD.
Jeremy Issacharoff, Israel's Ambassador to Germany wrote on Twitter on Saturday, “I fully object to Rafi Eitan’s statement made earlier. I find it hard to imagine how the man who caught Eichmann bringing him to trial in Israel, would praise Germans that are proud of the Nazi past and hope that such views could be an alternative for Europe! Sad and shameful.”
ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — The ISU Four Continents figure skating championships are returning to the U.S. for the first time in seven years.
The meet is scheduled for Feb. 7-10 at Honda Center in Anaheim, California, home to the NHL's Anaheim Ducks.
The competition in singles, pairs and ice dancing features skaters from the Americas, Asia, Africa and Oceania.
The U.S. team will be made up of three skaters or teams in each discipline and will be named after the U.S. nationals in Detroit on Jan. 19-27.
Last year, Americans Tarah Kayne and Danny O'Shea won the pairs title and Ashley Cain and Timothy LeDuc earned silver in Taipei. Americans Kaitlin Hawayek and Jean-Luc Baker won the ice dance title. Jason Brown won bronze in the men's competition.
The event was last held in the U.S. in 2012 at Colorado Springs, Colorado. The U.S. also hosted in 2006, 2007 and 2011.
MILWAUKEE (AP) — Bucks forward Jabari Parker is set to return to the court Friday against the New York Knicks, nearly a year after being sidelined with the second major left knee injury of his career.
Milwaukee said Monday night that Parker was medically cleared, making the announcement during the second quarter of its 107-95 victory against the Philadelphia 76ers.
Parker tore his left ACL on Feb. 8, 2017, against Miami. At the time, he was averaging a career-high 20.1 points and 6.2 rebounds as one of the franchise cornerstones.
Parker tore the same ACL in December 2014, ending his rookie season after 25 games. Milwaukee selected Parker with the second overall pick of the 2014 draft.
The return of Parker comes at an important time, about a week before the NBA trade deadline. The Bucks are also trying to reassert themselves as a contender in the East following the firing of coach Jason Kidd.

The 25-year-old Canadian man accused of mowing down pedestrians with a van in northern Toronto Monday has been charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and 13 counts of attempted murder.Alek Minassian, with a stone-faced expression and clad in a white jail jumpsuit, appeared in court this morning in Toronto, which is the sprawling capital of Ontario province. He is scheduled to appear in court again May 10 via video link.Minassian was arrested and taken into custody Monday as the suspected driver in the van attack, which killed 10 people and injured 15 others, according to the Toronto Police Service.Neighbors of Minassian, who lived in the Toronto suburb of Richmond Hills, described him as very quiet and odd. They told ABC News they saw him in the neighborhood -- including one neighbor who said he regularly saw him jogging -- but had never spoken to him.At a news conference in Canada's capital this morning, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau provided no suspected motive for the attack but said investigators still "have no reason to suspect that there is any national security element to this attack.""Obviously, all Canadians continue and will continue to have questions about why this happened, what could possibly be the motives behind it," Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa. "As was indicated last night by our public security minister, at this time we have no reason to suspect that there is any national security element to this attack, but obviously the investigations continue."Monday's attack began at Yonge Street and Finch Avenue in Toronto's bustling North York neighborhood, police said. The suspect then drove the white Ryder van south for nearly 1 1/2 miles, ramming into more pedestrians at Yonge Street and Sheppard Avenue. The vehicle finally stopped on Poyntz Avenue, just off Yonge Street.Witness Ali Shaker saw the van jump the sidewalk and said people walking were "crumbled up," he told Canada's CTV News "He's just hitting people one by one, going down," Shaker said. "It was a nightmare."Visibly frightened by what he saw, Shaker could barely recount the horror he witnessed. He said he was driving when the incident occurred."I'm so shaky -- I can't believe this is happening," he said. "This is so unbelievable."Shaker initially assumed the driver was experiencing some kind of medical emergency, he said, and even attempted to try to stop the driver from causing more carnage."I thought he had a heart attack or something so I was trying to chase him on the way, almost trying to catch up," he told CTV News, adding that the driver was moving fast."He hit everybody on the sidewalk; anybody in his way he would hit," Shaker added. "The bus stop -- all shattered. There was a lady in there I saw and I stopped and I looked and I went after and all I see is just crumbling one by one."Phil Zullo, who also witnessed the attack, told CTV News he saw "shoes and hats flown everywhere."Another witness said he stopped outside of a building for a smoke break and saw a middle-aged man get struck as he was crossing the street."As I lit up my cigarette I saw a man walking in the middle of the intersection and a van plowed right into him," the witness, who went by Steve, told CTV News. "I saw the guy go flying. ... It was just clear as day, just saw the guy get hit by the van and pieces of the van fell off."Afterward, Steve said he rushed into the middle of the street to tend to the injured man "to make sure no other cars struck him."The victim, he said, was around 50, was unconscious "and could barely move."The van kept driving and hit others, Steven added, leaving behind pools of blood."I saw three or four [people] on the ground around me," he said. "Other people were getting CPR."He's convinced that stopping for the cigarette break saved him, Steve said."I had just stopped to light the cigarette and if I hadn't done that I would have been killed as well," he said. "I would have been right there with that guy."Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto confirmed in a statement that it had received a total of 10 patients from Monday's incident. Two of them were pronounced dead upon arrival. Five others were in critical condition and three were in serious condition, the hospital said.Images from the scene showed multiple victims on the ground, while video showed the moment a single police officer confronted the suspect on the street.In the video, taken by an onlooker, the officer draws his firearm and stands off against the suspect, who appears to be pointing an object. The two exchange words, and the suspect eventually drops the object he was holding and gets down on the sidewalk, allowing the officer to handcuff him.During this morning's press conference, Trudeau called the incident "a senseless attack and a horrific tragedy." He told reporters he spoke with Ontario's premier and Toronto's mayor Monday night.Trudeau will go to Toronto "as soon as it makes sense to do so," he said, but doesn't want to distract from the investigation for now.Toronto Mayor John Tory told reporters Monday afternoon that his "thoughts are with those affected by this incident." He said the beautiful weather meant many people were out on the street."There were a lot of pedestrians out," Tory said, "enjoying the sunny afternoon."Canadian Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Ralph Goodale called the incident an attack but said he didn't want to speculate when asked whether the terrorism was to blame."We cannot come to any firm conclusions at this stage," Goodale told reporters Monday. "The police are conducting their thorough investigation into what happened and why it happened."U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen is in Toronto as part of the G-7 Security Ministerial, which is set to conclude today. A senior official with the U.S. Department of State told ABC News the U.S. delegation is safe.The White House released its first comment on the attack late-Monday night, saying, "The United States stands with the Canadian people in the aftermath of today's tragic event in Toronto, where a van drove into a crowd of people killing several and injuring many more.""Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of those affected, and we wish a full recovery to those injured," the statement continued. "The United States Government pledges to provide any support Canada may need."Ryder, the brand of rental truck involved in the incident, said in a statement it was saddened by "this tragic event" and extended its "deepest sympathies" to those impacted.The company also stated that it is "cooperating fully with authorities."
ELIZABETHTON, TN (WJHL) – Elzabethton residents who live along Ferguson Avenue may experience low water pressure, intermittent service and possibly no water until repairs are complete on a water line.

The work will impact customers from West Elk Avenue south, from Roan Street to Gap Creek Road.
The city says water crews will work until water service is restored.
West Lincoln medical facility still on the table

A withdrawn rezoning request that sparked more than an hour of heated discussion at a joint meeting between the Lincoln County Board of Commissioners and planning board earlier this month has been filed for a second time by Lincolnton Main Street, LLC.
The request, which calls to rezone three acres on the northeast corner of Highway 27 and Howards Creek Mill Road in western Lincoln County from residential single-family to conditional zoning general business, was withdrawn prior to a vote by the board of commissioners. The rezoning would permit the construction of a new 15,000 square-foot medical office building to house West Lincoln Family Medicine.
A community involvement meeting was conducted on Nov. 10 where a number of citizens expressed their concerns about the project, which included increased traffic and additional business development along Highway 27. Zoning administrator Randy Hawkins said that the meeting minutes, recorded by a representative of Lincolnton Main Street, don’t reflect the contentious nature of the meeting. When asked to elaborate, Hawkins said racial slurs referring to African Americans were used by an attendee who opposed the development.
Commissioner Carrol Mitchem questioned the need to rezone the parcel of land due to the fact that there is undeveloped land already zoned for business less than two miles away. The piece of land Mitchem referenced is located across the street from West Lincoln High School, behind the existing West Lincoln Family Medicine facility.
“We’ve got property 1.4 miles away that is readily available with roads that have been built to nowhere with the expectation of other businesses moving there,” Mitchem said. “Now, we’re going to move down the road 1.4 miles to create another area zoned for business. Throughout the years that I’ve been commissioner, we’ve always talked about things not being consistent with the land use plan and this isn’t consistent with the land use plan yet staff has recommended approval. I need some explanations.”
Hawkins said Lincoln County is in the process of updating its current land use plan, which has been in place for nearly a decade.
“The land use plan was adopted in 2007 and we’re now nine years removed from that,” Hawkins said. “We’ve had some community meetings on updating the land use plan and one of the things that we’ve heard at those community meetings is that there needs to be additional area in West Lincoln that is designated for commercial development … This area in question is a likely candidate for that designation.”
The planning board recommended approval of the original rezoning request by a 6-3 vote after a lengthy discussion. Dr. Crystal Mitchem, commissioner Mitchem’s sister-in-law, opposed the request and said she didn’t want West Lincoln to end up looking like Highway 16 in Denver.
Andrew Robinson, another member of the planning board, questioned whether Crystal Mitchem had a conflict of interest in the case. She owns West Lincoln Veterinary Hospital, which is located adjacent to the parcel of land proposed for development by Carrol Mitchem earlier in the night.
According to the minutes recorded during the Dec. 5 planning board meeting, Crystal Mitchem said that this is not a quasi-judicial case and she has no financial interest in the proposed property.
Max Abernathy, who owns the three acres of land in question, spoke of his affinity for Dr. Jason Glass, who operates West Lincoln Family Medicine. He also urged his fellow Vale residents to embrace the change because “it’s coming whether we like it or not.”
“I’ve lived on this land for almost 73 years so I’ve seen some things come and go,” Abernathy said. “That parcel is part of a little over 100 (acres) that I own and since this has gained attention I’ve had several others come to me about selling land, but I’m not in the business of selling land. The only reason that I entertained this one is because I believe that it will benefit the community. I want West Lincoln to improve and someday it’s coming because it’s a beautiful area. To hear some people talk, you’d think that a little change is the worst thing that could happen. Are we going to keep the rest of the world out of Lincoln County?”
The second rezoning request filed by Lincolnton Main Street, LLC, will be presented in front of commissioners and the planning board on Feb. 6. A second community involvement meeting will be conducted on Jan. 17 at 6:30 p.m. at the Howards Creek Fire Department, located at 3604 Highway 27 in Lincolnton.
Lewis has spent the last nine years as the head coach for women’s basketball at Cumberland, compiling a 150-116 record, and the last 17 years at Cumberland as a player, graduate assistant, full-time assistant coach or head coach with the men’s and women’s programs. He has been a part of eight of Cumberland’s 11 NAIA National Tournament appearances in school history between the two programs, including all three for the men and five of the eight for the women.
Lewis replaces Lonnie Thompson, who retired in late February after 16 years with the Cumberland program. The Phoenix posted an 11-18 overall record in 2017-18, including 11 losses to Mid-South Conference opponents, nine of those by a combined 48 points, as well as a 5-10 mark against ranked opponents.
“Jeremy Lewis has been a big part of the winning traditions in both the men’s and women’s basketball programs at Cumberland as a player and coach,” Pavan said. “He understands the culture of the program as well as the Mid-South Conference. We feel like he will do an outstanding job.”
The Hendersonville native just completed his ninth season as head coach for the Phoenix women, posting a 20-12 record and reaching the NAIA National Tournament for the fourth time in six seasons. The Phoenix also played in the national tournament in 2013, 2015 and 2016.
Lewis led the program to one of the most successful years in school history in 2012-13, finishing 33-3 overall and No. 4 in the final rankings, the most wins in school history. The Phoenix won the Mid-South Conference regular season and tournament titles and reached the NAIA Fab Four for the second time in program annals.
He was voted Mid-South Conference and Women’s Basketball Coaches Association Russell Athletic/Region 5 Coach of the Year during the campaign. Cumberland made its first appearance in the NAIA National Tournament since 2007.
“Ron gave me the opportunity to become a head coach nine years ago with the women’s program, and that time and experience has been invaluable,” Lewis said. “Coaching the men’s team brings different challenges, but I have the same set of winning expectations moving forward. I was a part of winning teams as a player and coach and want to bring the program back to that level of excellence.”
Four different players have garnered six All-America honors under Lewis’ tutelage, including Jessica Pace, Nicole Bowers (twice), Chelsey Hall (twice) and Casie Cowan, while the Phoenix have earned 21 All-Conference honors during his nine seasons as head coach. In addition, 41 players have been named Academic All-Conference with eight posting NAIA Scholar-Athlete accolades.
Before becoming the women’s head coach, Lewis served four seasons as a full-time assistant for coach Lonnie Thompson and the Cumberland men’s team. During his four seasons as an assistant coach, the Phoenix compiled a 68-56 overall mark, including 46-18 in the final two seasons with consecutive trips to the NAIA National Tournament in 2008 and 2009.
Lewis spent three seasons as the starting point guard at Cumberland from 2002-04 before he served one season as a graduate assistant for the Phoenix women’s basketball staff in 2005, which reached the NAIA National Tournament with a 26-9 record. As a player he was named Honorable Mention All-Conference as a junior and senior and garnered NAIA Scholar-Athlete and Academic All-Conference accolades as a senior. He was the starting point guard on Cumberland’s team that reached the Round of 16 and won the TranSouth Conference regular season championship in 2004.
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A study says the nation's largest public utility has given large businesses breaks on electric rates over six years while residential customers' rates increased.
The Synapse Energy Economics Inc. study says the Tennessee Valley Authority's industrial and direct-serve customers have received almost a 20 percent rate cut from 2011 to 2016, while residential customer rates increased 5 percent.
The report released this week says if the increases were applied equally, residential customers would've saved $1.4 billion.
Southern Alliance for Clean Energy Executive Director Stephen Smith said that's a complete distortion of TVA's mission.
Utility spokesman Scott Brooks said TVA also has an economic development mission. He said large manufacturing and commercial customers have used a 2015 change incentivizing off-peak power usage.
Brooks said TVA's residential rates are lower than 70 percent of competitors.
Hezbollah has published a list of items that Israelis "need to have in the next war."
Addressing Israelis in Hebrew, the list includes gas masks (because "the ammonia plant will be attacked"), shoes ("to run quickly"), pills ("to stay calm"), life vests (because "your battleships will be attacked with rockets"), and flashlights (because "your electricity stations will be attacked with rockets").
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Chris Pratt always declined previous offers to do commercials, but he made an exception for an upcoming Super Bowl spot — mostly because he likes beer.
Pratt will make his advertising debut Sunday in a pair of commercials for Michelob Ultra.
"I've watched every single Super Bowl since 1985," he said. "I'm a Super Bowl guy, and I definitely feel really connected not only to football and to the NFL and the Super Bowl, but also to the commercials... That's always the most exciting part for me, and it feels good to be part of that, like I'm a little tile in the mosaic of American culture."
The star of the "Jurassic World" and "Guardians of the Galaxy" film franchises also joked that being in a Super Bowl ad could "open things up" for him professionally.
"The Super Bowl launches people's careers — like Whitney Houston," Pratt said from his trailer on the set of the Michelob spot. "She sang the national anthem at the Super Bowl and it was like the highlight of the whole day, and then it launched her career... And I'm really hoping this is my Whitney Houston national anthem moment."
Houston was already a Grammy-winning star when she performed at the game in 1991. Pratt was among the world's highest-paid actors last year, according to Forbes.
He joins this year's crop of celebrities starring in Super Bowl ads, including Tiffany Haddish, Cindy Crawford and Morgan Freeman. The airtime alone for a 30-second spot this year costs more than $5 million this year.
Pratt, 38, said he approached the job just as he would a big-screen gig. He even bumped up his training for his next film, "Cowboy Ninja Viking," so he would be in peak condition for the commercial shoot.
"If I'm going to be having my shirt off... in front of 100 million people, I want to look good," he said, "so we worked really hard."
The commercial, dubbed "The Perfect Fit," is about balancing a healthy lifestyle with beer-fueled fun.
Pratt famously dropped 60 pounds before playing Star-Lord in the first "Guardians" film. Incorporating fitness into his life "changed everything," he said.
"It's not just an aesthetic thing," he said. "I sleep better. I feel better."
His favorite is exercising outdoors. Pratt said spending time in the woods near the farm he owns in Washington doesn't just keep him fit, it keeps him grounded. He particularly loves a trail there that passes through the woods and down to the beach.
"I feel the very best when I am running on that, and I feel very dialed in and close to nature and close to God," he said. "I think anytime you can just stop and worship this creation, it makes you feel good."

CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Aspiring Australian citizens will have to make a pledge to share Australian values under laws being introduced to Parliament.
Immigration and Border Protection Minister Peter Dutton said on Thursday that citizenship laws had to be reinforced to maintain public support for immigration and the value of citizenship in "an increasingly challenging national security environment and complex global security situation."
The bill does not spell out what Australian values are and critics of the proposal argue it would be difficult to get Australians to agree on what values they share.
The bill would also raise the bar on English-language skills for prospective citizens and extends the time that an applicant must be an Australian permanent resident from one to four years.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Two shipping containers full of hygiene kits languish for weeks in a Chinese port, unable to reach North Korea. They're intended for people with tuberculosis or hepatitis, not to advance nuclear or missile programs, but Chinese customs officers see something objectionable in the cargo: nail clippers.
As sanctions on Kim Jong Un's government intensify, the few aid groups operating in North Korea are facing sometimes bewildering economic restrictions and bureaucratic hurdles that could cripple life-saving work. While the U.N. Security Council says the penalties shouldn't affect humanitarian help, the Trump administration cites even North Korea's reported food and fuel shortages as evidence of a pressure campaign working.
The nail clippers were part of a consignment sent by Christian Friends of Korea, among the U.S. charities working in North Korea despite escalating nuclear tensions. The latest round of U.N. sanctions bans the supply of metal items, so that explains the clipper holdup.
It's not the only example. The American Friends Services Committee, another aid group, is struggling to deliver agricultural equipment such as threshers, compost makers and shovels.
"Sanctions should not have an impact on the well-being of ordinary citizens," said Linda Lewis, a member of the Quaker committee that's helped North Korean farmers for two decades. "This work should not be shut down for political reasons."
How do you pressure governments, short of war, to change their behavior without unduly injuring innocent civilians?
That's one of biggest questions for the economists, foreign policy professionals and political leaders who devise and put in place economic sanctions around the world. U.N. penalties routinely include broad exceptions for most basic civilian goods. Even when the United States targets its most intractable foes, it exempts food, medicine and humanitarian supplies.
In the case of North Korea, which the U.S. and others want to rid of nuclear weapons, it's unclear whether the right balance is being struck.
Citing reports last week from Tokyo of scores of North Korean fishing boats, with dead crews, drifting into Japanese waters, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the sanctions are "really starting to hurt." The human suffering, he said, was North Korea's responsibility and an "unavoidable outcome" of its failure to help its own people.
Tillerson also doubted that humanitarian assistance, which South Korea is considering, would reach the right people in the North.
His remarks alarmed humanitarian advocates. But given that the alternative to the U.S.-led pressure may be military conflict, the Trump administration is getting much leeway from international partners and the public over how the sanctions are affecting North Korea's 25 million people. Recent visitors to the isolated country say fuel prices have risen, but food supplies don't seem any scarcer. They anticipate conditions to worsen in the coming months.
Three times in the past year, the U.N. Security Council has tightened economic restrictions on North Korea, cutting fuel supplies and banning trade in the goods that make up 90 percent of the North's export revenue. The latest round, designed to punish a North Korean long-range missile test, prohibit selling the North iron, steel and other metals. That covers nearly 150 different categories of products, covering everything from stainless steel ingots to spoons and paper clips.
For U.S. aid groups, tiny operations already hindered by myriad requirements from U.S. authorities, the new rules are causing headaches. The groups need special export licenses from the departments of Commerce or Treasury; special U.S. customs inspections of their cargo; and State Department waivers to travel to North Korea. They also must contend with reluctant banks and suppliers, fearful of being fined for any transaction related to North Korea.
In the case of the nail clippers, Heidi Linton of the Christian Friends of Korea, which supports more than 30 tuberculosis and hepatitis care centers, said its routine shipment of hygiene kits was stuck this month in the northern Chinese port of Dalian for two weeks. Finally, Chinese customs gave special permission for the shipment to proceed. Without that decision, Linton would have had to pay people to individually unpack the metal nail clippers from several thousand kits for the two containers to be cleared.
"To what purpose?" asked a relieved and grateful Linton, who now wonders whether her group can import a replacement clutch for its vehicle in North Korea. It needs other metal items for renovating clinics and for clean water projects.
Lewis, from the Quaker aid group, echoed the sentiment.
"Now we can't even send shovels, anything made of steel," she said. Her group helps four cooperative farms in North Korea and had no problem with shipping basic agricultural equipment just a few months ago.
Lewis joked that the specific prohibition covering shovels must be an "excessively conservative interpretation" of dual-use technologies that are targeted in U.N. sanctions because they can have both peaceful civilian and lethal military uses. It's unclear what specific military use a shovel has.
For North Korea's civilians, the aid groups play a crucial role. The U.N. works on child health care and provided food for more than 800,000 North Koreans last year. "Sanctions may be adversely affecting that essential help," U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein told the Security Council last month.
The country is in far better shape than the famine years of the 1990s, when hundreds of thousands starved to death. But 70 percent of the people still suffer food insecurity, and 2 in 5 are undernourished, according to the U.N. The aid group Care International calls it the world's most under-reported humanitarian crisis.
Most governments refuse to help.
The U.S. last gave aid to North Korea a decade ago. Few others are stepping up when North Korea's Kim is being almost universally lambasted for plowing his impoverished nation's sparse resources into weapons.
The United Nations' $114 million humanitarian appeal last year, mostly for children and mothers, was only 30 percent funded. In November, the World Food Program was compelled by a money shortage to exclude 190,000 children from a program that offers cereal and enriched biscuits to the hungry.
China had long resisted the U.S. pressure to use all its economic leverage on North Korea. It's unclear why authorities are now interpreting the rules so strictly. The U.N. resolutions on North Korea specify they're "not intended to have adverse humanitarian consequences."
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying acknowledged the problems with humanitarian aid resulting from the North Korea sanctions, but said her country "always completely and strictly implements Security Council resolutions."

A group of IDF officers, led by Deputy Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Yair Golan, visited the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS George H. W. Bush (CVN 77) in the Mediterranean on Tuesday, February 14, for a day of familiarization and discussions with American naval personnel. US Embassy Chargé d'affaires Leslie Tsou also took part in the visit. While on board the vessel, the visitors received a briefing on the ship’s various combat capabilities and observed flight and maritime operations from the deck of the carrier. The tour and demonstration included an up-close view of aircraft catapult launches, arrested landings, and a tour of the ships vast aircraft hangars, flight squadrons, operation center, bridge, and flight control tower.
The purpose of the visit was to demonstrate the capabilities and firepower of USS George H. W. Bush and Carrier Strike Group 2, and to support cooperation between the U.S. and Israeli navies, as well as ensuring interoperability between the U.S. and its Israeli partners.
Such visits are a means of sustaining the U.S.’s long-standing alliance with Israel. The group were guests of the ship’s commanding officer, Capt. Will Pennington, and the commander of the Carrier Strike Group, Rear Adm. Kenneth R. Whitesell.
A key bottom line: The position is important, even vital. Why is Kennedy himself among North Dakota's highest paid public servants? Simple: Because Kennedy's salary is leverage. It's an investment by North Dakota in Kennedy's talent and connections, traits that Kennedy is expected to use to raise tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars for the university.
Fundraising is a huge part of a modern university president's job. So is running the complicated institution in a way that grows its reputation and strength.
If Kennedy succeeds at those goals, then North Dakota's investment will have more than paid off. And if the event coordinator helps Kennedy succeed, then the state will have spent its money wisely there, too.
Furthermore, critics hurt their case when they dismiss the coordinator as a "bartender." A glance at the job description sets the record straight. The description lists more than 50 duties, of which "serve as bartender during events" is only one.
Other duties include "initiate, plan and coordinate all official entertaining events hosted by the president and first lady," "coordinate all catering arrangements," "extend invitations and coordinate RSVP follow-up," "on-site management of the event," "track expenses," "oversee payment" and dozens of others.
As a thoughtful letter in Monday's Herald concluded, "to reduce the impressive multi-tasking that the event coordinator must do to just one of the more trivial duties in the job description is a disservice to her (the retiring incumbent's) valuable work and presence at UND."
That said, Kennedy must realize that with every UND staffer and student anxious about where the ax will fall, his own hiring decisions will be second guessed. People are watching, and a key to getting "buy in" from them will be showing that the administration is sharing—not just feeling—their pain.
That's where Kennedy should direct his attention, because that's why this hire touched a nerve.
It's the timing—meaning the timing of this particular hire, and what it seems to be saying about Kennedy's approach to UND's fiscal squeeze.
UND philosophy professor Jack Russell Weinstein was blunt about that perception. "They're cutting the law school, they're cutting the radio station and they're cutting courses, and the president is hiring a party planner," Weinstein told Herald Staff Writer Andrew Hazzard.
A few years ago, Altru Health System faced its own cutbacks. Here's how the headline in the next day's Herald read: "Altru tightens its belt; senior leadership taking pay cut until end of 2013."
Altru's approach generated comments, too; but those comments were a lot more forgiving of Altru's leaders. That's because the stakeholders knew the leaders were sharing in the sacrifice, not just doing it out. There's a lesson in that perception for Kennedy at UND.

JOHANNESBURG (AP) — South Africa's deputy president says anyone who acts corruptly must be punished regardless of identity, in a message reflecting national discontent with scandal-tainted President Jacob Zuma and his associates.
Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa made the remark on Tuesday as Zuma returned from an African Union summit in Ethiopia, where he made his own comments about corruption in Africa. Zuma acknowledged a problem but called it "quite exaggerated" at times and said entities outside the continent encourage African corruption for their own benefit.
Some members of the ruling African National Congress party are pushing for Zuma's early exit and say he shouldn't deliver the state of the nation address when parliament opens in Cape Town on Feb. 8. If Zuma speaks as scheduled, his speech likely would be met with protests.

Even though December 2016 was the wettest month since 1992, the Kinneret (Sea of Galilee) is the lowest it's been since January 2012. Currently, the Kinneret needs another 60 centimeters of rainfall until it reaches the lower red line.
During the month of December, the Kinneret rose 24 centimeters. While this was certainly significant, it was not an unusually high amount. Most of the water came from rivers which overflowed and ran into the Kinneret, from the northern lakes as well as from the northern coastline. As stated, the amount of water dumping into the Kinneret was the highest recorded since 1992.
In total, Israel receivd 113% of its annual rains during the months of September-December 2016. However, it is not enough.
The Kinneret's current level is -213.60 meters, which is 60 centimeters below the lower red line. It needs another 4.80 meters until it fills the lake entirely and reaches the upper red line.
In addition, the Dead Sea's level dropped 13 centimeters, measuring at -413.07 meters. During the same period last year, the Dead Sea dropped 16 centimeters.
PHOENIX (AP) — A rare second-degree murder trial of a U.S. Border Patrol agent accused of shooting across the international boundary into Mexico and killing a teenager is set to get under way with jury selection.
Lonnie Swartz is accused of killing 16-year-old Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez five years ago. The teenager was on the street in Nogales, in the Mexican state of Sonora, just across the border from Nogales, Arizona. An autopsy showed the unarmed teen was hit 10 times, mostly from behind.
The trial starting in U.S. District Court in Tucson on Tuesday comes amid President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration and his promise to build a wall along the 2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) U.S.-Mexico border.
Jury selection was set for Tuesday, with opening statements either later that day or on Wednesday, said Cosme Lopez, spokesman for the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona.
Lee Gelernt, a New York-based lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, said he believes Swartz will be the first border agent prosecuted by the U.S. Justice Department in a fatal shooting across the international border.
Gelernt is handling a civil lawsuit for the teen's mother, who is seeking monetary damages against Swartz.
"This historically important trial is coming at a time when all eyes are on the border," he said.
Prosecutors say Swartz opened fire at about 11:30 p.m. on Oct. 10, 2012, through the metal poles of a 20-foot (6-meter) fence that sits on a 25-foot (about 7.6-meter) embankment above Mexico's Calle Internacional, a street lined with homes and small businesses.
About 20,000 people live on the Arizona side and about 300,000 live on the Mexico side, but the two communities linked by family members, trade and culture have long been referred to locally as "Ambos Nogales" — "Both Nogales" in Spanish.
Swartz's lawyers have said Elena Rodriguez threw rocks just before he was shot in an attempt to create a distraction for drug smugglers and that the officer was justified in using lethal force. They want jurors to visit the site at night to experience the area after dark.
Witnesses from the Mexico side of the border said they did not see the teen throw rocks and his relatives have denied he was helping drug smugglers, saying he was walking home after playing basketball.
The U.S. Attorney's Office has said it won't dispute that the boy was throwing rocks, but it's unknown if he had any link to drug smugglers. They argue an unreasonable amount of force was used.
Swartz pleaded not guilty after being indicted by a federal grand jury in 2015 and is currently on administrative leave and free on his own recognizance. The Border Patrol has not said if he is continuing to receive his salary.
Defense attorney Sean Chapman has declined to comment while the trial is ongoing. A spokesman for the agents' union, the National Border Patrol Council, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
The case is expected to last more than a month and activists who oppose U.S. border policies say they will rally outside the courthouse.
"For so long, prosecutors have been reluctant to charge Border Patrol agents with violent crimes," said John Fife, a retired Presbyterian minister who was active in the sanctuary movement that sheltered citizens of Central American countries who came to the U.S. in the 1980s fleeing civil war. "Now we will see if they can be held accountable."
THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The Netherlands' main intelligence service says it is treating a small group of Dutch children in conflict zones in Iraq and Syria as "Jihadist travelers" since they may have received military training.
In a report published Wednesday, the General Intelligence and Security Service says at least 80 Dutch children are in those areas, either having been born there or taken there by one or both parents. It says fewer than 20 percent of the children are age 9 or older.
The report says that because children in territory controlled by the so-called Islamic State group "sometimes receive weapons and combat training from as young as nine years old," intelligence officials consider them jihadi travelers.
Dutch authorities routinely detain people caught returning from Syria if they are suspected of extremist links.
NEW YORK (CBSNewYork/AP) — A witness described hearing a “boom” Monday after police said a man detonated a crude improvised device near the Port Authority Bus Terminal during morning rush.
It happened around 7:19 a.m. in an underground walkway between Times Square and the bus terminal subway stations in the area of 42nd Street between 7th and 8th avenues.
Christina Bethea was starting off her week rushing to work when she said the device exploded about 50 feet from her.
“To me it sounded more like a loud gunshot, like ‘boom’ and it was over. Then smoke came and I ran upstairs. I don’t know what happened after that,” she told 1010 WINS’ Glenn Schuck. “When you hear ‘boom,’ smoke, that means get the hell out of there. That’s what I did.”

The 29-year-old from Yonkers, who was unhurt in the blast but shaken, decided not to go to work as a security guard and instead will spend time with friends in Harlem to calm her nerves.
The explosion triggered a massive response by police and firefighters both above and below ground, tangling subway and bus service.
“What are people thinking? You got crazy people walking around,” a man named Justin told WCBS 880’s Alex Silverman.
Elrana Peralta, a customer service worker for Greyhound, said she works in the Port Authority terminal complex near where the blast happened, but didn’t hear the explosion.
“All we could hear was the chaos,” she said. “We could hear people yelling, ‘Get out! Get out! Get out!'”
John Miles, 28, from Vermont, was waiting for a bus to Massachusetts. He also didn’t hear the blast, but saw police react.
“I didn’t know what was going on. Officers were running around. I was freaking out,” he said. There was an announcement that people should take their bags and leave. “They didn’t incite panic. It was fairly orderly.”
At least three people were hurt in the explosion that Police Commissioner James O’Neill called “terror-related.”
Speaking at a news conference, O’Neill identified the suspect as 27-year-old Akayed Ullah.
Police said he had a crude improvised device attached to his body using Velcro and zip ties and said video shows him walking down the passageway when the device exploded.
O’Neill said by the time officers arrived, they found Ullah with burns and wounds to his body. He was taken into custody and transported the hospital.
Police asked anyone with information about the incident to call the Terror Hotline at 888-NYC-SAFE.

CINCINNATI (AP) — Police near Cincinnati say the mother of a 10-month-old girl sat her down in a car seat on a driveway and then apparently forgot she was there and backed a vehicle over the child, who later died.
Police say it appears to be a tragic accident that occurred midday Tuesday in Union Township, just east of Cincinnati in Clermont County.
Township police say the woman left her younger child on the driveway while tending to an older child in the vehicle, then started to drive and hit the younger child. Police say the girl was rushed by helicopter to a children's hospital but died Tuesday evening.
Investigators haven't publicly identified the family involved. The incident remains under investigation.
SEATTLE (AP) — A man who was brought to the U.S. illegally as a child but was protected from deportation by the Obama administration has been taken into custody in the Seattle area in what could be the first case of its kind in the country. Daniel Ramirez Medina, 23, was arrested Friday by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who went to the suburban Seattle home to arrest the man’s father. ICE spokeswoman Rose Richeson said in a statement that agents were there targeting a “prior-deported felon.” Ramirez, however, was brought to the U.S. from Mexico when he was 7 and has a work permit under Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. He also has a job, a young son and no criminal record, Northwest Immigrants Rights Project Legal Director Matt Adams said. Ramirez is being held in Tacoma. Richeson said Ramirez told agents he was a gang member and based on those statements and being a “risk to public safety,” he was taken into custody. But Mark Rosenbaum, one of Ramirez’s lawyers, responded later Tuesday that Ramirez “unequivocally denies being in a gang” and that the statement from Richeson is inaccurate. “While in custody, he was repeatedly pressured by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to falsely admit afiliation,” Rosenbaum said. Adams said Ramirez is the first person he knows of with DACA status who has been detained. “This appears to be a complete one-off. We certainly haven’t seen this with our other hundreds of clients who have DACA status as well.” Attorneys for Ramirez challenged his detention in federal court in Seattle Monday, arguing the arrest violates his constitutional rights to live and work in this country without the fear of arrest and deportation so long as he satisfies DACA requirements. “Trust in our government depends upon the Executive Branch keeping its word,” Ramirez attorney Mark Rosenbaum, director of Public Counsel’s Opportunity Under Law Project, said in a statement. “Bait and switch sullies the integrity of our nation’s core values.” Emily Langley, a spokeswoman for the US attorney’s office in Seattle, said Tuesday afternoon it would be premature to comment on the lawsuit. Recent sweeps by U.S. immigration agents across multiple states have netted some immigrants with no criminal records, a departure from enforcement actions in the last decade. Under the Obama administration, agents focused more narrowly on individuals who posed a security or public safety threat. President Donald Trump made illegal immigration a cornerstone of his campaign, saying he will build a wall along the Mexican border and deport millions of people, although actual plans have yet to be revealed. He has said he wants to focus on people who have committed crimes. During an interview with Time magazine late last year, Trump expressed sympathy for the more than 740,000 people in the DACA program, which started in 2012. “We’re going to work something out that’s going to make people happy and proud,” he told the magazine. Trump can withdraw the promised protection right away through an “operational memo” because Obama implemented it through one, William Stock, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said previously. Adams said he believes Ramirez was apprehended by mistake. “I don’t think this has to do with any change in policy; I just think it was an enforcement procedure gone wrong,” Adams said. “Hopeful they’re going to come to their senses.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — In a remarkably public clash of wills with the White House, the FBI declared Wednesday it has "grave concerns" about the accuracy of a classified memo on the Russia election investigation that President Donald Trump wants released.
The FBI's short and sharp statement, its first on the issue, laid bare a Trump administration conflict that had previously played out mostly behind closed doors in meetings between top Justice Department and White House officials.
"As expressed during our initial review, we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo's accuracy," the FBI said.
Further complicating the memo's release, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee said late Wednesday that his committee's vote to release the memo was now invalid because it was "secretly altered" by Republicans who wrote it. California Rep. Adam Schiff said in a letter to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes that committee Democrats had discovered changes that were made after the panel voted Monday to send it to Trump for review.
"The White House has therefore been reviewing a document since Monday night that the committee never approved for public release," Schiff said in the letter.
Schiff did not detail the changes, and a spokesman for Nunes did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump has five days from the vote to review the document, and if he doesn't object then Congress can release it.
Schiff called for Nunes to withdraw the memo from the White House and for the committee to hold a new vote next Monday.
The memo is part of an effort to reveal what Republicans say are surveillance abuses by the FBI and the Justice Department in the early stages of the investigation into potential ties between Russia and the 2016 Trump presidential campaign.
The FBI's stance on the memo escalates the dispute and means Trump would be openly defying his hand-picked FBI director by continuing to push for its disclosure. It also suggests a clear willingness by FBI Director Christopher Wray, who in the early stretch of his tenure has been notably low-key, to challenge a president who just months ago fired his predecessor, James Comey.
The FBI statement came the day after Trump was overheard telling a congressman that he "100 percent" supported release of the four-page memo.
Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday night placed the blame on House Speaker Paul Ryan, saying that if Ryan "cares about the integrity of the House or the rule of law, he will put an end to this charade once and for all."
Democrats have called the memo a "cherry-picked" list of GOP talking points that attempts to distract from the committee's own investigation into Russian meddling in the election that sent Trump to the White House.
The drama comes as special counsel Robert Mueller also is investigating whether the Trump campaign improperly coordinated with Russia during the campaign and whether Trump sought to obstruct the inquiry by, among other actions, firing Comey.
Under the House committee's rules, the president has five days to object to the memo's release, which the panel voted to authorize Monday. But Trump himself already has urged the release, and it could come sooner. By late Wednesday, it had not yet been settled whether the White House or the committee would handle the actual release.
Earlier this week, Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein made a direct appeal to White House chief of staff John Kelly not to release the memo, warning that it could set a dangerous precedent.
But the president has been undeterred.
Television cameras captured Trump, on the House floor after the State of the Union address, telling South Carolina Rep. Jeff Duncan that he backed the release. When Duncan implored him to "release the memo," Trump said: "Oh yeah, don't worry. 100 percent."
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told CNN Wednesday that a legal and national security review of the document was continuing. Trump had not read the memo as "as of last night prior to and immediately after the State of the Union," she said.
White House chief of staff Kelly said Wednesday on Fox News Radio that he expected the memo to be released "pretty quick."
Trump has been telling confidants in recent days that he believes the memo will validate his concerns that the FBI and Justice Department had conspired against him, according to one outside adviser familiar with those conversations but not authorized to speak publicly about private discussions.
The president also has told allies that he believes the memo bolsters his belief that accusations of collusion between his campaign and Russian officials are false and part of a conspiracy to discredit his election.
On Wednesday afternoon, Nunes fired back at the law enforcement agencies, calling the FBI and Justice Department objections "spurious."
"It's clear that top officials used unverified information in a court document to fuel a counter-intelligence investigation during an American political campaign," Nunes said. "Once the truth gets out, we can begin taking steps to ensure our intelligence agencies and courts are never misused like this again."
Nunes stepped aside from leading the committee's investigation last April amid an ethics investigation into whether he had improperly disclosed classified information. He was later cleared and resumed his leadership role.
The White House counsel's office has been in possession of the memo, officials say. The National Security Council is leading a review, which will also involve the White House legal team.
The vote to release the memo was unprecedented in the committee's history. The panel usually goes out of its way to protect classified information in the interest of shielding intelligence sources and methods.
In the hours before the Monday vote, Rosenstein and Wray warned Kelly that releasing the memo could set a dangerous precedent, according to a person familiar with the conversation. Rosenstein also told Kelly the memo didn't accurately characterize the FBI's investigative practices, the person said.
The Justice Department had said in a letter last week that it would be "extraordinarily reckless" to release the memo without first giving the FBI and the department the chance to review it.
After those complaints, Wray reviewed the memo over the weekend. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., who was with him when he reviewed the memo, said the FBI director did not raise any national security concerns. Gowdy said the memo doesn't reveal any intelligence methods but does reveal "one source."

PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) — Kosovo's prime minister has suspended significant pay increases for top government officials amid a wave of criticism.
Ramush Haradinaj on Wednesday said the government suspended them and will wait for a Constitutional Court verdict on the issue.
On Tuesday, Kosovo's Agency Against Corruption said there was no legal basis for the government's decision to double or significantly raise the salaries of top officials. Thirty lawmakers then asked the Constitutional Court's opinion on the legal basis of such a decision.
In late December, the government decided to raise salaries, doubling it for the prime minister to 2,950 euros ($3,656) a month before taxes. The average salary in the country is 354 euros a month ($438).
Kosovo is one of Europe's poorest countries.

NEW DELHI (AP) — A media watch group has expressed serious concern at "an alarming deterioration in the working environment of journalists in India" and demanded that the government ensure the safety of journalists who are feeling threatened.
Reporters Without Borders said in a report Wednesday that that at least three journalists were killed in India in 2017 and that a fourth case is still under investigation. In 2018, the situation appears to have worsened significantly, with four journalists killed in the first six months of the year.
The report said, "The hate speech directed toward journalists has increased massively, causing serious concern for their safety."
There was no immediate reaction from the Indian government.
The group demanded a swift and independent investigation of cases in which journalists have been targeted.

In the future, the food delivery company wants AI to take over while engineers sleep
UK-based food delivery company Just Eat runs a hugely complex devops culture across 35 software development teams in five geographies, working together to maintain 450 microservices.
At peak times Just Eat is processing 2,700 orders per minute, normally on a Saturday evening, which requires them to spin up in excess of 1,500 AWS instances. The engineering team ships up to 500 releases a week and generates 1.5TBs of logs per day.
Building a central SRE team
Site reliability engineering is of paramount importance for Just Eat, as it is to rivals like UberEats and Deliveroo, as outages cause an oversized reaction from hungry customers.
Take Just Eat's reported outages on New Year's Day, its second busiest day of the year after Valentine's Day, where a tweet from the company reporting technical issues across its website and app received more than 200 responses, some verging on the dramatic side. "You're ruining my life!" one user tweeted.
Speaking at the London leg of the AppDynamics World Tour last week, Richard Haigh, director of technology at Just Eat, said: "Site reliability engineering all starts with this first premise: we believe truly that dev teams own their product, full stop.
"So the devs create the code, they ship it, they look after it in the evenings, they take the pages home and we call them at 3 o'clock in the morning if their code fails and they help fix it. They own that code cradle to grave."
However, those dev teams aren't alone, they are supported by dedicated SRE teams, who run on what Haigh calls 'five pillars'. These are:
Relentlessly protect site availability
Enable change to be delivered fast but baking quality in using automated delivery pipelines
Optimise the use of infrastructure and resources - using scalable cloud solutions and ensuring the right spend there
Innovate to stay ahead, especially when it comes to tooling - wether it is open source, commercial or built in house - to have the best possible solution
Fostering a blameless culture and enabling autonomous teams
This starts with a central SRE team of 50-60 people who run a 24/7 service operations centre. "Their job is to boss the first ten minutes of any problem we've got," Haigh said.
This team also looks after hosting across various cloud platforms, delivery automation (CI/CD pipelines), all monitoring, logging and alerting sitting under a team they call 'observability' internally, and service management run by a set of country managers.
Tooling
In terms of aligning these teams, Just Eat runs a whole range of activities to keep lines of communication open.
This starts with a daily standup to review any issues they had seen in the past 24 hours and prioritise next steps. Teams also run weekly risk meetings ahead of the busy weekend period. Lastly there is a monthly technology all-hands to discuss lessons learned and new tooling.
When it comes to tooling, Just Eat wants to fall in the sweet spot between giving development teams complete autonomy and a central team dictating which tools to use.
"We try to support that diversity and decentralisation but at the same time control some of the things that are larger in scale and more important to the business," Haigh said.
"So we have central support for a range of tooling like the monitoring stack, but we give dev teams the opportunity to interact with that in an open source way, so they can take a version, fork it, manipulate it and give it back to us and we say that's great and incorporate it back into the code base for everyone."
However dev teams adopting new tools "go into that knowing the risks and taking that on, but there is also survival of the fittest," Haigh said. "So if you have chosen that tool and it turns out to be absolutely awesome - we've seen this with something like Slack recently - the next team takes it and we get to the point where it's best in breed and we take that onboard to try and find some of those economies of scale, enterprise support and make it easier for others to adopt it."
Bennie Johnston, head of site reliability engineering at Just Eat also explained from the stage how the company has had to scale devops over the past four years due to some pretty serious growth at the publicly listed company, from just one release a day to nearer 500 per week today.
For example, four years ago the Just Eat dev teams were falling back on written run books to help resolve issues.
"Run books weren't the way we were going to scale devops," Johnston said. "Just Eat kept being successful so we got more and more dev teams. What we realised was our platform-as-a-service team needed scaling and that is where the deployment of monitoring came in."
So the team went out to market to look for the right tools to help automate some of these processes. "That's where AppDynamics came in, as well as our internal SRE team building tools to give the operations teams buttons and levers to affect the flow of traffic and protect that core user experience," he said.
Speaking about AppDynamics in particular, Johnston outlined how it allowed Just Eat to centralise monitoring.
"We had monitoring-as-a-service from very early on, it was one of the things that allowed us to do devops, if you are operating something you need to be able to see it," he explained.
However monitoring was developed by individual teams for their own services, so it was fractured.
For example: "For the Order API we had some great metrics, but from an operations point of view we had very little visibility into what was actually going on. We didn't even really have real time order rate, this was something that came out of our database three days later.
"AppDynamics gave us the ability to look across all of our teams and services to correlate cause across and gave us that visibility into our systems," he said.
AI
So, what next for JustEat? "We want incident resolution AI," Haigh said.
At the moment managers will arrive to work in the morning to a raft of HipChat chat logs to pick through any incidents that occurred overnight.
"My dream is to come in one morning and there has been an incident but we won't have had to wake any engineers up," Haigh added. "In fact the bots and systems we are looking at will have identified where something has gone wrong and find what they need to do to recover those systems.
"If we get really good those dependent systems will talk to each other and will understand the implications of making that change. Those systems will work together to resolve that and then we will run sanity checking and it is logged in those same HipChat channel so that when we, the humans, come in after a good night's sleep we can see exactly where the system was hurting and how to alleviate that moving forwards."
Tuesday - Thundery showers mainly over northern and eastern Singapore in the afternoon.
Wednesday - Late morning and early afternoon thundery showers.

COLUMN: Best name in racing shows willpower to win Indy 500 Will Power, of Australia, apologizes to 2018 500 Festival Queen Scholar Natalie Murdock after dousing her with milk while celebrating the win at the Indianapolis 500 auto race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, in Indianapolis Sunday, May 27, 2018. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings)
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- William Stephen Power was named after his great-grandfather, an Australian motorbike racer who ''set records from Toowoomba to Brisbane'' and sparked a love of motorsports passed down three generations.
Will Power.
Legendary drag racer John Force called it the greatest name in motorsports.
Now it will forever be linked to ''The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.''
Five years after pledging to improve on ovals, Power won on the biggest one in the world and took one of Roger Penske's cars to victory in the Indianapolis 500. The Indy win was the 17th for Penske, elected to the NASCAR Hall of Fame just last week, and made Power the winningest IndyCar driver in Team Penske history.
He's won 31 times for Penske, but Sunday's victory at Indianapolis Motor Speedway was just his seventh triumph on an oval. His specialty is winning on road and street courses, and no one has been more consistent at those venues than Power over the last decade.
The road to improvement started in 2013, the year after Power coughed up another championship, and he turned his focus toward mastering those vexing ovals on the schedule. When he won that season's finale in California, he declared himself fit to consistently challenge for wins.
He conquered the Milwaukee Mile the next year, the year he became a champion, and has since won twice at Pocono, once at Texas and now on the grandest stage in motorsports.
''I just got better and better and better at ovals. Just absolutely love them now,'' Power said Monday. ''Understand them so well. I know exactly what I want, exactly how the car should feel, know how to drive them, know when to take risks. That just took time. Now I would race them every week if I could.''
Yes, his path to this life-changing Indy 500 victory began five years ago with an attitude change.
Story Continues
The extra push he needed came a month ago, at an NHRA event at Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina.
Power had the weekend off, and having never been to the drag races, he figured an afternoon in a different environment might do some good. The first four races of the IndyCar season had not gone his way: He'd been in two race-ending accidents and was seventh in the championship standings.
That day at zMax Dragway, watching NHRA drivers race four-wide down the strip, helped turn Power's season around.
He was stopped everywhere he went in the paddock and given an in-depth tour of the cars, engines and setup from Funny Car driver Ron Capps. Courtney Force, who is married to IndyCar regular Graham Rahal, took a selfie with Power to show ''at least one IndyCar driver came to see me on their weekend off,'' because her husband had a prior engagement.
Then Power saw Courtney Force's father, 16-time champion John Force and one of the most powerful personalities in motorsports. Power broke free from his group, raced over to Force and was entertained for 30 minutes by racing stories told in Force's bold, embellishing style.
As Power made his way out of the paddock, he was randomly stopped by the father of seven-time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson, who recognized Power in passing and told him what he fan he was of the driver.
When the day ended and Power and his wife headed home, his demeanor had changed. He had that swagger back, admitting the afternoon was a massive confidence-booster before heading to Indy.
Power got to the great gray speedway nestled in a neighborhood and won on the road course, the warmup to the Indy 500. His toddler son took his first steps while the family was in Indianapolis. He didn't make a mistake the entire month of May and parlayed that into the biggest win of his career.
''It was kind of the turning point. I went down there and had a really good time,'' Power said of the trip to the drag races. ''We were joking around a lot. That's like, the happiest times in your life, when you are around friends and you are totally in the moment, joking around, trying to be funny, and not thinking about the past or the future. That was a day like that.''
A relaxing day. The kind of day that a guy who is driven - in his own quirky way - can use as a reset in trying times.
Power arrived in Indianapolis so much looser than ever before. He knew Penske had given him a fast Chevrolet, and if everything went right, he had a shot at winning. And when he did, the victory celebration was like few before.
Power didn't cry, but he couldn't stop screaming. He's not even sure what he said in that hectic celebration. He maintains a dairy-free diet, so he took just one sip from the celebratory milk - ''It was whole cream,'' he said, because he couldn't choose chocolate - and decided to shower it through the winner's circle ''NASCAR-style.'' He wound up drenching Indianapolis festival princess Natalie Murdock.
Mortified once his wife pointed out Murdock, who had milk covering her eyeglasses and running down her face, Power could not have been more apologetic.
In truth, that might have been William Stephen Power's only slip-up all month.
''It was better to just be in the moment. I don't regret anything I did,'' he insisted. ''I don't care what people say. I do not care. I was in the moment, and that's how I've been lately. I could not care less what people think about me. I am going to be myself. I like it, and that's basically it.''

WASHINGTON (AP) — Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has signed a proposed rule that would restrict the types of scientific studies regulators can use to determine the impact of pesticide and pollution exposure on human health.
Pruitt says the change would increase transparency in the agency's decision-making by requiring all underlying data used in scientific studies to be made publicly available.
Critics, including former EPA administrators and scientists, say Pruitt's move is designed to restrict the agency from citing peer-reviewed public-health studies that use patient medical records required to be kept confidential under patient privacy laws.
The embattled EPA administrator signed the proposed order at EPA headquarters Tuesday in an event that was livestreamed on the agency's website but not open to press coverage.
The United Way of Prince Edward County doled out $15,000 on Wednesday, June 20 – bringing to $50,000 its yearly allocation to its 20 partners. The $50,000 allocation for the fiscal year was the most in the 10 years of the group’s records that United Way President Rucker Snead reviewed. The previous high was $47,000 in the 2015-2016 fiscal year, Snead said. The United Way doled out $35,000 during its first distribution of funds in January.

New temporary visa class to have tougher requirements, prime minister says
The government will abolish the 457 temporary visa class, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced today.
457 visas have been widely used by the technology sector, with some groups such as the IT Professionals Association (ITPA) claiming that they have been abused by employers.
“We’re abolishing 457 visas – the visas the bring temporary foreign workers into our country,” Turnbull said in a video posted on Facebook.
“We will no longer allow 457 visas to be passports to jobs that could and should go to Australians.”
The 457 visa will replaced by a new temporary visa class, Turnbull said.
“The new visa will better target genuine skills shortages, including in regional Australia,” the PM said. “It will include new requirements, including previous work experience, better English language proficiency and labour market testing.”
The government will also establish a new training fund, Turnbull added.
Addressing a press conference this afternoon Turnbull and immigration minister Peter Dutton said that the existing four-year 457 visa class will be replaced with two new temporary visas.
A new medium-term visa will have a four-year term and cover a relatively narrow list of occupations. The four-year visa will require a “higher standard of English” and “in almost all cases” mandatory market testing, Turnbull said.
There will be capacity for visa renewal onshore and a permanent residence pathway after three years under the medium-term stream, the government said.
Another visa stream will have a two-year duration and cover a broader list of occupations, though the PM said that the occupations covered by the visa will be substantially reduced compared to the list of 200+ currently eligible for 457 visas.
At the end of the two years, there will be the possibility of lodging an onshore application for a two-year extension; after four years, however, the visa holder would have to leave and their employer reapply.
The immigration department said the the occupation list for skilled migration visas, including 457 visas, will be significantly reduced from 19 April.
Both visa categories will require at least two years’ relevant work experience. There will be a minimum market salary rate (currently $53,900).
There are some 95,000 457 visa holders in Australia, according to the government. There will be a grandfathering arrangement for existing 457 visas.
Figures from the Department of Immigration and Border Protection reveal that as of 30 September, during the 2016-17 financial year Australia’s information media and telecommunications sector has lodged 2000 457 visa applications, up 4.8 per cent on the same point in 2015-16.
The information media and telecommunications sector accounted for 14.4 per cent of all primary 457 visa applications in the period covering applications through to 30 September.
‘Developer programmer” was the second most popular occupation for 457 visa applications in the period covered by the immigration department’s report. ICT business analyst was fifth most popular; software engineer came in at number seven and analyst programmer at number 13.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is planning to impose tariffs on European steel and aluminum imports after failing to win concessions from the European Union.
That's according to two people familiar with the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The people say the administration's plans could change if the two sides are able to reach a last-minute agreement, but an announcement is expected before Friday's deadline.
President Donald Trump announced in March he would slap a 25 percent tariff on imported steel, and a 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum, citing national security interests.
But he delayed the implementation for several countries, including the European Union, giving them time to negotiate a deal.
The EU has said it will retaliate if the exemptions lapse.
LONDON (AP) — England winger Anthony Watson is set to miss the tour of South Africa in June after being ruled out for the rest of the season with a left Achilles injury.
Watson was hurt in a tackle in the first half of England's 24-15 loss to Ireland on Saturday, the final day of the Six Nations.
Watson, who underwent rehabilitation work on another Achilles injury last year, had only just displaced Mike Brown as England's fullback. He has 15 tries in 33 tests.
DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Officials say rescuers are searching for up to six people still missing after landslides killed at least 141 in southeastern Bangladesh.
Fire department deputy director Jasim Uddin said Thursday that all of those still missing were in the worst-hit region of Rangamati.
Elsewhere, the government turned its focus to providing food and other aid to some 4,500 people whose homes were swamped by mud and debris unleashed in the landslides Tuesday.
With power cut off since Tuesday in the remote, hilly region, information was slow to trickle out.
PARIS (AP) — A cold case in France is heating up, with three new arrests this week over the 1984 killing of a 4-year-old boy named Gregory.
The investigation has involved family rivalries, judicial bungling and 12,000 pieces of evidence – including about 2,000 anonymous letters – in the three decades since his corpse was pulled from a freezing river in eastern France.
The Burgundy gendarme service and Dijon appeals court said in a statement that three people were arrested Wednesday. Local newspaper L’Est Republicain reported that they were a great-uncle, great-aunt and aunt of Gregory’s and that they are suspected of complicity in the killing.
A relative was initially jailed but released – and then killed by Gregory’s father. Then Gregory’s mother was accused of killing her son, before being cleared.

HAMDEN, Conn. (AP) — A dean from UCLA has been appointed the next president of Quinnipiac University in Connecticut.
Judy Olian, who currently serves as dean of UCLA's Anderson School of Management, will become Quinnipiac's first female president when she takes over for John Lahey, who will retire at the end of June.
Olian's appointment was announced Monday by William Weldon, the chairman of Quinnipiac's Board of Trustees, nine months after the private school launched a nationwide search for Lahey's successor.
"We are confident she will build on the university's current momentum and strong foundation and will lead Quinnipiac to further impact and national recognition," Weldon said.
Olian has served as dean at the Anderson School of Management since 2006. She is credited with raising more than $400 million for student and faculty support at the school. She previously served as dean and professor of management at Penn State and professor and senior associate dean at the University of Maryland.
"I'm attracted to the purpose and mission of Quinnipiac, and its comfort in leading change," Olian said. "I've seen a remarkable trajectory of growth in this university. I am eager to partner across the community in building on that."
In addition to her academic duties directing UCLA's graduate business school, Olian also has written a weekly syndicated newspaper column and hosted a monthly television show on current topics in business.
Lahey has led the school since 1987 as it grew from a small college into a university of nearly 10,000 students on three campuses. The number of graduate students has grown from 106 to almost 3,000 as the school established several new departments including a school of medicine, a school of law and a school of engineering.
The university now awards 2,600 degrees annually, compared to only 575 when Lahey arrived 31 years ago.
He also oversaw the transition from Division II athletics to Division I.

With the Trump administration vowing to tighten rules for skilled workers entering the United States, India's software services companies are worried. Indian IT giants outsource tens of thousands of tech specialists to the United States each year, and limiting the visa program that brings them in could disrupt their multibillion-dollar industry.
Congress and the White House have targeted what is arguably the most coveted of U.S. visas: the H1-B. It's "a kind of temporary work visa that allows professionals from other countries to work in the United States for a designated U.S. employer," explains Stephen Yale-Loehr, a Cornell University immigration law professor.
Yale-Loehr says that with the economy picking up, the program is in particularly big demand. Last year, U.S. companies that sought to bring highly skilled workers to the U.S. filed 236,000 petitions that went into a lottery for just 85,000 H1-B visas, the legal cap. The bulk of the winners: Indian computer specialists, many of them graduates of U.S. universities.
Yale-Loehr says that places like Europe and Australia have special visas to attract such talent, but that the United States doesn't.
"We have to shoehorn high-tech workers into categories like the H1-B, and it's getting more difficult every year," he says.
Indeed, newly introduced legislation in Congress and drafts of executive orders reportedly circulating in the Trump White House would tighten the H1-B program.
Indian software services firms last year earned 60 percent of their $108 billion in export revenues from the U.S. Their executives will travel to Washington this month to lobby against measures that take aim at one of India's most successful industries.
One bill proposes more than doubling the minimum wage of H1-B holders, which by law is set at $60,000. Critics argue the H1-B has been misused to displace American workers, and that there has been an incentive to prefer Indian IT workers because they are cheaper.
Shailesh Chitnis, with the data mining and analysis company Compile, says that while the median salary for all H1-B holders is $71,000, most but not all Indian outsourcers pay below that. If they had to double salaries, Chitnis says, Indian IT companies would have to change their 20-year-old business model.
"Because these organizations are not going to be bringing in people at $120,000 to fill those jobs — it would simply be too expensive," he says. "They'll have to look at some other alternatives."
But Shevendra Singh with India's National Association of Software Services Companies, or NASSCOM, refutes allegations that Indian companies are dislocating American workers or supplying low-paid labor. Singh says there is demand in the U.S. for Indian technical talent because of a severe shortage of qualified Americans with degrees in science, technology, engineering and math.
"The crux of the issue is the STEM skill shortage in the U.S.," Singh says.
In its 2012 report, the U.S. president's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology found that "fewer than 40-percent of students who enter college intending to major in a STEM field complete a STEM degree." The council concluded that in the next decade, economic forecasts point to a need to produce "approximately 1 million more college graduates in STEM fields than expected under current assumptions."
R. Chandrashekhar, president of NASSCOM, says that if the skills aren't available in the U.S. — and companies can't bring workers in — the jobs either won't get done or they will go out of the country and be done remotely.
"Talent has become more important than investment or trade," he says. "And those who consciously cut themselves off from the global supply chains of talent are depriving themselves of a good thing."
Chandrashekhar notes that the intermingling of American and Indian ingenuity helped build Silicon Valley, and says protectionist impulses could weaken the United States, and what makes it unique.
"America is No. 1," Chandrashekhar says. "What has really helped them to rise, absolutely, to the top, is that they have attracted talent from across the world. ... It would be really a pity if that was reversed without thinking it through."
Immigration expert Yale-Loehr, co-author of a 21-volume treatise on immigration law, agrees that the United States faces a crisis in maintaining its innovative and competitive edge, and says it should be inviting more, not less, IT talent to its shores.
"In a globalized economy, the best and the brightest want to work in the best places — and if they're unable work in the United States, or it takes too long or is too difficult, they'll find a place in Canada or Europe or India where their talents can be appreciated," he says.
If implemented, Yale-Loehr says the draft executive order would initiate a review of the H1-B program but likely have no direct, immediate impact.
However, he says "it sends a strong signal that we no longer like foreign workers — we're all about only U.S. workers."
That, Yale-Loehr says, is eventually going to hurt the U.S.

In India, tech companies are worried that the Trump administration is preparing to limit visas for foreign skilled workers. A huge number of those visas called H-1Bs are held by Indians, but Congress and the White House say the program could be a threat to American jobs. From New Delhi, NPR's Julie McCarthy has more.
JULIE MCCARTHY, BYLINE: In the alphabet soup of U.S. visas, the H-1B is arguably the most coveted.
STHEPHEN YALE-LOEHR: An H-1B visa is a kind of temporary work visa that allows professionals from other countries to work in the United States for a designated U.S. employer.

PAYSON, Utah (AP) — The father of a boy who has Down syndrome is suing the Boys Scouts of America for blocking his son from becoming an Eagle scout and revoking his merit badges.
Logan Blythe has been a scout through the National Parks Council in Utah. His father, Chad, says the 15-year-old has advanced because the council has made accommodations when necessary.
He had planned to create kits for special-needs babies for his Eagle project when the family learned the national organization voided every merit badge he obtained.
The family sued the Boy Scouts and the Utah National Parks Council for "outrageous and reckless conduct."
The organization says it worked with the committee and the Blythe family to offer "alternative merit badges" and a path to becoming an Eagle.
DETROIT (AP) — Audi is recalling about 391,000 cars and SUVs in the U.S. and Canada because the electric coolant pumps can overeat and possibly cause a fire.
The recall covers the 2013 to 2016 A4, the 2013 to 2017 A5, the 2012 to 2015 A6, and the Q5 SUV from 2013 to 2017. All have 2-Liter turbocharged engines.
The Volkswagen luxury brand says in government documents that the pumps can become blocked with cooling system debris, or moisture in the pump can cause an electrical short. No reports of fires are listed.
Dealers will replace the pumps at no cost to owners. Audi says redesigned parts won't be ready until November, but dealers will install a new version of the current pump until the redesigned ones are available.
OXON HILL, Md. (AP) — The Latest on the Scripps National Spelling Bee (all times local):
6:05 p.m.
Forty-one spellers have advanced to the finals of the Scripps National Spelling Bee out of a field of 516, by far the biggest in the 93-year history of the competition.
The finalists were announced Wednesday after two days of onstage spelling during which nearly 200 spellers were eliminated for getting words wrong. Scores on a written spelling and vocabulary test determined who advanced to the finals.
There were no perfect scores on the test. Bee executive director Paige Kimble says, "We thought it was an easy test. We were wrong."
The top scorers were Shruthika Padhy, Aisha Randhawa and Karthik Nemmani.
Shruthika already came into the bee as one of the favorites, having finished in seventh place last year.
The past 13 champions and 18 of the last 22 have been Indian-American.
5:19 p.m.
With the Scripps National Spelling Bee extended to three days this year, longtime pronouncer Jacques Bailly finally needed some help.
Bailly's understudy for the past 16 years, the Rev. Brian Sietsema, filled in for him during portions of Wednesday's competition.
Sietsema is a Greek Orthodox priest from Michigan, as well as a former linguistics professor and lexicographer.
Bailly is the longtime public face of the bee. He says it was hard to take his first-ever break, but he knew it was necessary.
This year's bee nearly doubled in size because Scripps started a wild-card program that allowed kids who didn't win their regional bees to get to nationals. More than 500 spellers competed over two days of preliminary rounds. No more than 50 finalists were to be announced later Wednesday.
United Nations Middle East envoy Nikolay Mladenov told the 6th Global Forum for Combatting Antisemitism on Monday evening that the UN is committed to educating the world against racism and xenophobia.
