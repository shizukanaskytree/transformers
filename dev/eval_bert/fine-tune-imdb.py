### {'label': 1, 'text': 'Bromwell High is a cartoon comedy. It ran at the same
###  time as some other programs about school life, such as "Teachers". My 35
### years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that Bromwell High\'s
### satire is much closer to reality than is "Teachers". The scramble to survive
### financially, the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic
### teachers\' pomp, the pettiness of the whole situation, all remind me of the
### schools I knew and their students. When I saw the episode in which a student
### repeatedly tried to burn down the school, I immediately recalled ......... at
### .......... High. A classic line: INSPECTOR: I\'m here to sack one of your
### teachers. STUDENT: Welcome to Bromwell High. I expect that many adults of my
### age think that Bromwell High is far fetched. What a pity that it isn\'t!' },

### { 'text': 'I rented I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW from my video store because of all the
###     controversy that surrounded it when it was first released in 1967. I also
###         heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to
###     enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered
###         "controversial" I really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The
###         plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who
###         wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants
###         to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the
###         average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the
###         Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking
###         politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on
###         politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married
###         men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40
###         years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and
###         nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it\'s not shot like
###         some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in
###         reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even
###         Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had
###         sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for
###         the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes
###         rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in
###         pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film
###         for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of
###         Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn\'t have much of a plot.',
